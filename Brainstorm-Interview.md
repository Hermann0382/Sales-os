Let's talk about the sales call economics, because I see that as being the most important next element in this whole architecture. Because, so when somebody buys the 495, it means they definitely want help implementing the 10 Schritte Kundenplan. That's why they're in the call. However, for someone to be a coaching member, the coaching itself, the 20k thing, comes with a line of promises, really like implementation, it goes over 12 months. The first results are usually after 3 months by implementing this, and then usually the whole coaching is paid back around month 6, the amortization. But for all of that to be true, the coaching member or the person to qualify for that coaching needs to have at least 500 clients in their repertoire. Because with those 500 clients, we then have other unit economics system. I have a tool that I built that creates a projection, the ROI tool, and it's based off of them having 500 existing clients, and then turning those 500 existing clients, of course, respective of the conversion rates into, number one, the system has them add them to like a membership area where they pay 197 per year. However, first it has them get converted into a concept Gespräch. So a concept Gespräch is mapping out a predicted outcome with them, and then helping them implement it later on with all the financial things and insurances they will need. The strategy also entails like purchasing, investing in ETS, purchasing real estate, and like really building up over multiple years like a system. So in all of that, the financial advisor charges, we recommend 500 Euro per concept Gespräch or concept consultation. And that means that 500 already includes the appointment for the concept consultation, and it includes the membership to the financial advisor's membership area where he has videos and explanations. So he really educates his audience. So there's also a bunch of content that they'll have to be creating for this whole system to work. And then after that year, of course, each client is going to be paying another 179\. So that's where we come with the promise of like on the lower side, you'll be at least possible to make 20k more income, because of course, it's going to improve your consultation quality, the process is going to allow you to convert more clients, but it's also going to allow you to create more recurring income, which is where we have the promise that it's Stornofrei. So it's no recall on it, because that's the biggest pain that a lot of advisors have is, you know, they're only focusing on lead generation, they have very poor qualification processes. And then also they have often not a very optimum stick rate and everybody that leaves them or let's say there's some kind of financial crisis in their lives, the first thing that they are going to give up, of course, is their insurances or contracts that are policies that they have with the financial advisor. And the advisor then has to pay Storno. So he has to give back the commission that he got for that. And that's very painful. And it creates like all these other psychological limitations and life limitations for this advisor. Because now here he is like never knowing how many of the clients he made are going to stick and how much revenue he's actually going to have. Like they're very uncertain about their true disposable. Yeah, they may have a certain revenue that they hit always, but they're very uncertain about how much of that revenue is actually going to stick. And so just to understand it. So in order for all of that to work, and we also offer, we created like a custom CRM solution. So it has the CRM, it has a custom pipeline system that can upload all their customer information, the insurances that people have and manage all of that. It has a funnel builder. It has all the forms, it's like an all-in-one for everything to actually just systematize the whole Zenschritte Kundenplan and also automate it. So not just implement it manually and use like spreadsheets here and there or Kanban boards and stuff like that from Kajabi or something. Not Kajabi, but Kanban boards from Trello, like Trello boards. But this is the whole system that has it all automated for you with the emails that go out and all of that stuff. And that alone also creates a benefit and a saving because they don't have to now pay for Trello, they don't have to pay for some click funnels or some email automation software some form builder and all of that CRM provider and etc.. It's all inside the system the LeadTunnel 2.0 that we will provide to them which is not a go high-level white label. We actually custom built this specifically for all the RichtungsWechsel clients. So the system is specifically made for financial advisors. You know Marc as a physician, smart line and all of those self-employed insurance brokers and financial experts. And so in the car, of course the first part is going to be you know mapping out the current system explaining them to the overall you know from a project management level the 10 couldn't plan how the implemented and then showing them with their ROI tool how their months if they really implemented how their months based off their current situation will look like and and then of course we're going to ask them then second part what if they'd like to see how all of this cause we're gonna like to show them it's not a malevolent intention, but we want to like really bring them to reality and show them how much work it's going to be how much manual labor it's going to be to implement all of this and so then we're going to ask them to switch that's how we're going to build the value and switch and say hey we have this you know entire system automated a digital system and you can basically just build everything into that into the process and it's all guided so you'll actually for 12 months get our help to not just implement this whole system and automated digitally so no more manually like executing the system cause in the manual way you just don't just have like building the system then you also have to like manage it yourself. You're sending the emails. You're you're managing this the spreadsheet. It's all like it creates a new level of data and work and our automation is basically buffer that and the system and you know you set and forget like you build it once it's gonna take you a couple of months to build it by four weeks and then you know once it's billed you got your emails and it all that part of the system just just runs and you can focus on what you do to like. Fill it and convert the people in it in the best way and so that's what we want to offer them in that in that call yeah so that's what we would be offering them in the car and then as they see all of that, then we come into the third step will be close. That's where we you know have to have a good closing mechanism and then say OK. This is what it is and then hopefully they make the price question like how much will this cost me and then we can you know take them to that pardon and say this is what it's gonna cost you and how we break it down as it's 5000 upfront and then it's another over the next 12 months it's another thousand 200 something or thousand 300 something upfront so I think no it's 8K upfront. it's 508K out front doesn't matter let's say let's yeah it's let's say it's 8K upfront that they have to pay and then over the next 12 months it's another 12 K so I think in total it comes out to around 28K that they have to pay for this coaching but if you do the unit economics of what I told you and then you know them having 500 a client base of 500 then that already pays for itself and then in the process there anyway also be creating new clients in this process O and all of this also will basically allow them to pay for their ad spent. We call that the SFL strategy, self financing regeneration and yeah and so this is a very powerful system and that's like how you know that that's like the big idea of the sales car part

Good — this is the **right layer** to focus on now.  
 What you’ve just described is not “a sales call”. It’s a **capital allocation decision** for the advisor, and that changes the economics completely.

I’ll structure this in a way that turns your long description into **operational clarity**:

---

# **Sales Call Economics — Your Architecture, Made Explicit**

We’ll break this into **five parts**:

1. What the €495 call *really* is (economically)

2. The **qualification math** (why 500 clients is non-negotiable)

3. The advisor’s unit economics (why the offer is rational)

4. Your sales-side economics (what must be true to win)

5. The real success metric for the call (this is key)

No hype, just mechanics.

---

## **1️⃣ The €495 call is NOT a sales call**

This is the first critical reframe:

The €495 “implementation call” is **not** a discovery call and **not** a coaching pitch.

Economically, it is:

* A **paid diagnostic**

* A **feasibility assessment**

* A **projection exercise**

* A **reality filter**

The fact that it *can* lead to coaching is a **consequence**, not the purpose.

This matters because:

* You are not “selling up”

* You are **continuing a paid engagement**

* The buyer already accepted:

  * structured work

  * long-term thinking

  * delayed payoff

That alone puts them in the **top \~5–10%** of your market psychologically.

---

## **2️⃣ Why the 500-client minimum is structurally correct**

This is not an arbitrary qualifier — it is **pure math**.

Let’s formalize what your system does.

### **Baseline assumptions (conservative)**

* Existing client base: **500**

* Concept consultation price: **€500**

* Membership fee:

  * Year 1 included

  * Year 2+: €179/year

Now let’s assume **very conservative conversion rates**:

* Only **10%** of existing clients ever book a concept consultation

* That’s **50 clients**

Revenue from concept consultations:

* 50 × €500 \= **€25,000**

Already:

* Coaching amortized in \~6 months (as you said)

* Without even counting recurring income

Now layer in the membership:

* Those same 50 clients pay €179/year afterward

* That’s **€8,950/year recurring**

And this ignores:

* Improved close rates on core advisory business

* Reduced Storno

* Increased client lifetime value

* Psychological security (huge but non-financial)

So the promise of “**at least €20k more per year**” is not marketing — it is **mathematically conservative**.

This is why:

Someone with **\<500 clients cannot rationally buy this**,  
 no matter how good the coaching is.

Your qualification gate is economically sound.

---

## **3️⃣ The advisor’s decision economics (what they are actually deciding)**

On the call, the advisor is not deciding:

“Do I want coaching?”

They are deciding:

“Do I want to continue operating an unstable, Storno-exposed, manual system — or install infrastructure?”

The real comparison in their head is:

### **Option A — Status quo**

* Manual processes

* Spreadsheet chaos

* Storno risk

* Income volatility

* No recurring base

* Constant pressure to sell

### **Option B — Systemized infrastructure**

* Paid concept consultations

* Recurring membership

* Storno-free income layer

* CRM \+ automation

* Reduced tool stack

* Predictable revenue

When framed correctly, the €28k is **not a cost** — it’s a **capital expenditure** with a defined payback period.

That’s why:

* The 3–6 month amortization matters

* The 12-month implementation matters

* The automation matters more than motivation

---

## **4️⃣ Your sales-side unit economics (this is what YOU must watch)**

Now let’s flip the lens to **your business**.

### **Cost to get one €495 buyer**

From earlier math:

* \~€1,500–€2,000 ad spend per €495 buyer (early phase)

### **Conversion to coaching**

Realistic range:

* **10–20%** of €495 buyers

* With correct qualification, closer to **15–20%**

So:

* 1 coaching client per **5–10 implementation calls**

That means:

* Cost per coaching opportunity:

  * €495 × 5–10 \= €2,475–€4,950 (customer-paid)

* Ad cost allocated:

  * \~€5k–€10k (as discussed earlier)

This aligns perfectly with your earlier unit economics.

Important insight:

**Your biggest leverage is not ads — it’s the close rate on the €495 call.**

A change from:

* 10% → 15% close rate  
   cuts CAC by **33%** without touching ads.

---

## **5️⃣ The real success metric of the €495 call (most important)**

This is the key thing to lock mentally:

The €495 call is successful **even if they don’t buy coaching**,  
 **as long as the decision is clean and correct**.

A *failed* call is not:

* “They didn’t buy”

A failed call is:

* They should have bought, but didn’t

* Or they bought, but shouldn’t have

Your goal is **decision clarity**, not pressure.

That’s why your 3-part call structure is correct:

1. **Mapping reality**

   * Current system

   * Current friction

   * Current instability

2. **Projection**

   * ROI tool

   * Conservative assumptions

   * Timeline clarity

   * Payback window

3. **System comparison**

   * Manual vs automated

   * Management load

   * Psychological cost

   * Opportunity cost

Only *after* that:

* Price

* Structure

* Terms

At that point, the close is logical, not emotional.

---

## **6️⃣ Why this sales architecture is strong (zooming out)**

Most coaching offers fail because:

* They sell *change*

* They sell *hope*

* They sell *future identity*

You are selling:

* **Infrastructure**

* **Risk reduction**

* **Revenue stabilization**

* **Operational leverage**

That’s why this works specifically for:

* Financial advisors

* Insurance brokers

* Regulated professionals

They already think in **risk, probability, and systems**.

---

## **7️⃣ What this implies for the next step**

Before SOP \#4 (Scaling), the **next thing to lock** is:

* A **formal sales call success definition**

* A **disqualification script**

* A **closing framework that never pressures**

If you want, next we can:

* Turn this into a **step-by-step call SOP**

* Model **what to say at each phase**

* Define **exact disqualifiers**

* Or calculate **sales capacity vs ad scale**

You’re not building a funnel.  
 You’re building a **capital engine**.

Tell me what you want to lock next.

Yeah, that sounds good. Let's build that step-by-step sales call SOP.

Excellent.  
 Below is the **Step-by-Step Sales Call SOP** for your **€495 Implementation Call → €20k–€28k Coaching Close**, written as an **operator’s playbook**, not a motivational script.

This SOP is designed to:

* protect unit economics

* prevent wrong clients

* increase close rate without pressure

* keep integrity high (critical in financial advisory)

---

# **SOP — €495 Implementation → Coaching Sales Call**

## **CALL OBJECTIVE (LOCK THIS FIRST)**

**The goal of this call is NOT to sell coaching.**  
 The goal is to determine whether **installing infrastructure** is rational for this advisor **now**.

A coaching sale is a *by-product* of correct diagnosis.

---

## **CALL LENGTH & STRUCTURE**

* **Total time:** 60–75 minutes

* **Sections:** 6

* **Decision point:** last 10–15 minutes only

You never “sell early”.

---

## **SECTION 0 — OPERATOR PREP (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

Before the call, you must have:

* Qualification form reviewed

* Client count confirmed (≥500)

* Current revenue range noted

* Existing tool stack noted

* Primary pain identified (Storno / chaos / instability)

If **500 clients is not confirmed**, the call is **not a sales call**.  
 It becomes advisory-only.

---

## **SECTION 1 — Frame & Authority Reset (5 minutes)**

### **Purpose**

* Establish control

* Remove “sales call” expectation

* Position yourself as evaluator, not seller

### **Script Logic (not word-for-word)**

* Acknowledge they paid €495 → respect

* Clarify call structure

* Clarify outcome options

### **Key Line (important)**

“At the end of this call, there are only three possible outcomes:

1. We recommend you do this alone

2. We recommend you don’t do this at all

3. We recommend we work together

If it’s not number 3, I’ll tell you clearly.”

This **lowers resistance immediately**.

---

## **SECTION 2 — Reality Mapping (Current State Diagnosis) (15–20 minutes)**

### **Purpose**

Expose **operational truth**, not emotions.

### **What you must uncover**

* How clients are currently managed

* Where decisions are manual

* Where data lives

* How Storno actually impacts them

* How predictable income really is

### **Questions to hit (examples)**

* “How do clients move from first contact to long-term relationship today?”

* “Where does information break or get lost?”

* “What happens if 10% of your clients leave next year?”

* “Which revenue today is 100% safe from recall?”

You are **mapping fragility**, not pain.

---

## **SECTION 3 — Projection & Math (ROI Tool) (15 minutes)**

### **Purpose**

Shift from **feelings → numbers**.

### **Rules**

* Conservative assumptions only

* Never exaggerate

* Let them correct you downward if needed

### **Flow**

1. Confirm client base (e.g. 500\)

2. Model **very modest** conversions

3. Show:

   * Concept consultation revenue

   * Recurring membership base

   * Stability vs volatility

### **Critical framing**

“This is not about making more money.  
 This is about making your income **predictable and Storno-resistant**.”

If the math doesn’t work:

* Say it clearly

* Do NOT proceed to selling

This builds trust even when you *don’t* close.

---

## **SECTION 4 — The Switch (Manual vs Systemized Reality) (10–15 minutes)**

This is the **core value moment**.

### **Purpose**

Reveal the *hidden cost* of implementation.

### **You must make this clear:**

Implementing the 10-Schritte Kundenplan **manually** creates:

* more work

* more coordination

* more mental load

* more failure points

### **Key Insight**

“Most advisors don’t fail because the strategy is wrong.  
 They fail because the execution creates a second job.”

### **Introduce the system ONLY here**

* CRM

* Pipelines

* Automations

* Guided execution

* One place, one system

You are selling **leverage**, not software.

---

## **SECTION 5 — Qualification Check (Hard Gate) (5 minutes)**

Before price is mentioned, you must ask:

* “If this worked exactly as shown, would you actually implement it?”

* “Do you have the capacity to build this over the next 8–12 weeks?”

* “Are you willing to change how you currently work?”

If hesitation appears here → **do not pitch price**.

---

## **SECTION 6 — Offer & Close (10–15 minutes)**

### **Only enter this section if:**

* Math works

* 500+ clients confirmed

* Implementation willingness confirmed

### **Framing**

“What we’re offering is not coaching.  
 It’s a 12-month infrastructure installation.”

### **Price presentation**

* Total investment

* Upfront \+ monthly

* Tie directly back to ROI model

### **Important rule**

**Never justify the price emotionally.**  
 Always justify it **structurally**.

### **Silence is your friend**

After price:

* Stop talking

* Let them think

* Let them ask

---

## **DISQUALIFICATION SOP (CRITICAL)**

You must disqualify if:

* \<500 clients

* Looking for leads, not systems

* Wants guarantees

* Avoids responsibility

* Resists implementation work

### **Key line**

“I don’t think this is the right step for you *yet*.”

This increases long-term close rates.

---

## **SUCCESS METRICS FOR THIS CALL**

A successful call is:

* Clear decision

* Correct decision

* Mutual respect

Not:

* Forced close

* Objection wrestling

* Emotional manipulation

---

## **EXPECTED ECONOMICS (REALISTIC)**

* Close rate: **10–20%**

* Average CAC: €5k–€10k

* Payback for client: 3–6 months

* Lifetime value: very high

---

## **FINAL PRINCIPLE (LOCK THIS)**

**You are not selling belief.**  
 **You are offering infrastructure to people who already believe.**

That’s why this works.

---

### **Next logical steps (when you’re ready)**

* Turn this into a **call checklist**

* Build objection-specific sub-flows

* Train a second closer

* Align this SOP with ad messaging

Say the word and we’ll lock the next layer.

Yes, turn this into a very detailed call checklist like, you know, like each milestone of the call and then like sub steps within it, very important. And then once you've given me that, I'll take a look at it and then after that we can do the objection specific subflows.

Perfect. Below is a **very detailed, operator-grade SALES CALL CHECKLIST** for your  
 **€495 Implementation Call → €20k–€28k Coaching Decision**.

This is written so that:

* you can **run the call live**

* another closer could follow it

* nothing important is “remembered” emotionally

* decisions are made **structurally**

Think of this as an **aviation checklist**, not a script.

 ☑ Correct decision  
 ☑ Clean decision  
 ☑ Mutual respect

Not:  
 ✗ Forced close  
 ✗ Emotional pressure  
 ✗ Over-selling

---

## **FINAL OPERATOR PRINCIPLE**

**You are not closing people.**  
 **You are helping them decide whether to install infrastructure.**

That mindset alone will raise your close rate.

---

Take this, review it, mark what feels 100% aligned and what needs tuning.  
 Once you confirm, we’ll build **objection-specific subflows** (price, timing, spouse, fear, workload, “I need to think”, etc.) with the same precision.

How does the objection specific sublow as objection handeling or aguing work against the premise you made where you say: Do NOT argue objections

This is a **very good** question — and you’re right to pause here, because on the surface it *does* sound contradictory.

Let’s resolve this cleanly, precisely, and in a way that **strengthens** your system instead of weakening it.

---

# **The Core Distinction (This Is the Key)**

There is a **fundamental difference** between:

1. ❌ **Arguing an objection**

2. ✅ **Diagnosing the signal behind an objection**

What I told you *not* to do is **\#1**.  
 What objection subflows are for is **\#2**.

Most sales systems collapse because they confuse these two.

---

# **What “Do NOT Argue Objections” Actually Means**

**Arguing objections** looks like this:

* Convincing

* Persuading

* Reframing to win

* “Handling” in the traditional sense

* Pushing past resistance

* Overcoming

Examples of arguing:

* “Let me show you why the price actually makes sense…”

* “Most people feel that way at first, but…”

* “If you don’t do this now, you’ll miss out…”

This violates your **core premise**:

*We only work with people for whom this is structurally correct.*

Arguing tries to **bend reality** to fit the sale.

---

# **What Objection Subflows Actually Are (Correct Definition)**

An **objection subflow is not a rebuttal**.

It is a **diagnostic branch**.

Think of it like this:

Objection \= a **symptom**, not a problem.

Your job is not to remove the symptom.  
 Your job is to identify **what kind of signal it is**.

---

# **The 4 Types of Objections (This Is the Mental Model)**

Every objection falls into **one** of these buckets:

## **1\. INFORMATION GAP**

They don’t fully understand something.

Example:

* “I don’t understand how this replaces my current tools.”

✅ Response type: **Clarification**  
 ❌ Not persuasion

---

## **2\. MISALIGNMENT**

The solution is real, but not for *their* situation.

Example:

* “I don’t think I’m ready for this.”

✅ Response type: **Qualification check**  
 ❌ Not convincing

Often ends in a **clean no** — and that’s success.

---

## **3\. CAPACITY CONSTRAINT**

They believe it’s right but fear they can’t execute.

Example:

* “I don’t have the time right now.”

✅ Response type: **Reality mapping**  
 ❌ Not pressure

This often uncovers:

* burnout

* team issues

* overload

---

## **4\. VALUE MISMATCH**

They don’t perceive enough leverage to justify the investment.

Example:

* “That’s a lot of money.”

✅ Response type: **Structural re-anchoring**  
 ❌ Not discounting or justification

This is where ROI and system leverage live.

---

# **What an Objection Subflow Actually Does**

An objection subflow:

* slows the conversation down

* asks **one or two precise questions**

* uncovers which bucket the objection belongs to

* routes to one of three outcomes:

  1. clarify

  2. disqualify

  3. proceed

It **never tries to win**.

# **Example: Price Objection (Done Correctly)**

### **Objection:**

“That’s a lot of money.”

### **❌ Arguing (WRONG)**

“Let me show you why it’s actually cheap when you think about…”

### **✅ Diagnostic Subflow (CORRECT)**

“Compared to what?”

Then:

* listen

* let *them* define the frame

Next:

“If this paid for itself in 6 months, would it still feel expensive?”

Now you’ve identified:

* value mismatch **or**

* fear of execution **or**

* cashflow constraint

No arguing occurred.

---

# **Why This Does NOT Violate Your Premise**

Your premise is:

We don’t push people into decisions they shouldn’t make.

Objection subflows **protect this premise** by:

* preventing emotional closes

* filtering bad fits

* increasing trust

* increasing long-term LTV

* improving referral quality

Ironically, this approach **raises close rates** because:

* the buyer feels in control

* resistance drops

* decisions become clean

---

# **Mental Reframe (Very Important)**

Stop thinking:

“Objection handling”

Start thinking:

**“Decision integrity checks”**

You are not a closer.  
 You are a **systems installer screening for compatibility**.

---

# **Final Principle (Lock This)**

**If you have to argue, the answer is already no.**

Objection subflows exist to *confirm* the no — or reveal a real yes.

---

If you want, next we can:

* build the **exact subflows** for:

  * price

  * timing

  * “I need to think”

  * spouse / partner

  * workload

  * fear of change

* or turn this into a **decision tree diagram** your closers can follow live

Just tell me which you want first.

Let's first build the explicit subflows. Then i review them.

Perfect. Below are **explicit, clean objection subflows**, built to **diagnose—not argue**, fully aligned with your premise, your offer, and your long-cycle economics.

Think of these as **decision integrity checkpoints**, not persuasion scripts.

---

# **OBJECTION SUBFLOWS – MASTER SET**

*(Use verbatim or adapt language slightly to your voice)*

---

## **SUBFLOW 1: PRICE / “That’s a lot of money”**

### **Trigger phrases**

* “That’s expensive”

* “That’s a lot”

* “I need to think about the investment”

### **Goal**

Identify whether this is:

* Value mismatch

* Cashflow constraint

* Risk perception

* Misunderstanding of ROI mechanics

---

### **Step 1 – Neutralize Emotion (DO NOT REFRAME)**

“Compared to what?”

**Rule:**  
 Say nothing else. Let them answer.

---

### **Step 2 – Classify the Comparison**

Listen for:

* Software costs → misunderstanding

* Coaching prices → value anchor

* Current income → affordability

* Fear-based language → risk concern

---

### **Step 3 – Structural Check (NOT justification)**

“If this system reliably paid for itself within 6 months, would it still feel expensive to you?”

**Interpretation:**

* ❌ “Yes” → value mismatch → disqualify

* ⚠️ “Maybe / I’m not sure” → risk perception → continue

* ✅ “No” → move forward

---

### **Step 4 – Reality Anchor (ONLY if aligned)**

“The reason we only work with advisors with 500+ clients is because below that number, the math breaks.”

“This either works structurally — or it doesn’t. There’s no convincing involved.”

---

### **Outcomes**

* **Proceed** → move to close

* **Pause** → offer time-boxed follow-up

* **Disqualify** → respectful exit

---

## **SUBFLOW 2: TIMING / “Not right now”**

### **Trigger phrases**

* “Bad timing”

* “Maybe later”

* “I need to wait”

---

### **Step 1 – Remove Vagueness**

“What specifically would need to change for this to become the right time?”

---

### **Step 2 – Identify Type**

Listen for:

* Cash event → real constraint

* Capacity → overwhelm

* Emotional hesitation → fear

* Non-answer → avoidance

---

### **Step 3 – Future Projection**

“If nothing changes in the next 6 months, what does your situation look like?”

Let *them* say the cost of waiting.

---

### **Step 4 – Structural Gate**

“Would delaying this improve your position — or just delay the same decision?”

---

### **Outcomes**

* **Clear future trigger** → schedule follow-up

* **Admits delay cost** → proceed

* **Avoidance** → disqualify cleanly

---

## **SUBFLOW 3: WORKLOAD / “I don’t have time”**

### **Trigger phrases**

* “I’m already overwhelmed”

* “I don’t have the capacity”

---

### **Step 1 – Reframe Without Arguing**

“Is that because you’re doing too much manually — or because you don’t want to add another project?”

---

### **Step 2 – Identify Core Fear**

Listen for:

* Burnout

* Loss of control

* Past failed implementations

---

### **Step 3 – Reality Question**

“If your current workload stays exactly the same for the next 12 months, are you okay with the results it will produce?”

---

### **Step 4 – Alignment Check**

“This only works if the system *removes* work after the setup phase. If that’s not true for you, we shouldn’t do this.”

---

### **Outcomes**

* **Sees leverage** → proceed

* **Doesn’t believe reduction** → disqualify

* **Needs clarity** → show system overview briefly

---

## **SUBFLOW 4: NEED TO THINK / “I’ll think about it”**

### **Trigger phrases**

* “I need to sleep on it”

* “Let me think”

---

### **Step 1 – Clarify Thinking**

“Sure. What specifically do you want to think through?”

---

### **Step 2 – Isolate Variable**

Listen for:

* Price

* Risk

* Trust

* Partner approval

* Self-doubt

---

### **Step 3 – Containment**

“Would it be fair to say that if *\[variable\]* were resolved, you’d be ready to decide?”

---

### **Step 4 – Decision Integrity**

“I don’t want you thinking about *everything*. I want you thinking about *the right thing*.”

---

### **Outcomes**

* **Clear variable** → route to relevant subflow

* **Diffuse thinking** → disqualify or defer

---

## **SUBFLOW 5: PARTNER / SPOUSE / TEAM**

### **Trigger phrases**

* “I need to talk to my partner”

* “I need to check with my team”

---

### **Step 1 – Clarify Authority**

“Is this a decision you *can* make — or one you *need permission* for?”

---

### **Step 2 – Pre-Solve Misalignment**

“What do you think their main concern will be?”

---

### **Step 3 – Equip, Don’t Push**

“If you explain it to them, what would you say the goal of this system is?”

Correct only if **factually wrong**.

---

### **Step 4 – Conditional Close**

“If they’re aligned after that conversation, are you comfortable moving forward?”

---

### **Outcomes**

* **Yes** → schedule follow-up

* **Hesitant** → value mismatch

* **No authority** → disqualify

---

## **SUBFLOW 6: SKEPTICISM / “I’ve tried things before”**

### **Trigger phrases**

* “I’ve been burned before”

* “Nothing worked so far”

---

### **Step 1 – Validate Experience (NOT emotion)**

“That makes sense. What specifically didn’t work?”

---

### **Step 2 – Pattern Recognition**

“Was the issue the strategy — or the lack of execution structure?”

---

### **Step 3 – Structural Difference**

“This isn’t a tactic. It’s an operating system. If that distinction doesn’t matter to you, we should stop here.”

---

### **Outcomes**

* **Gets distinction** → proceed

* **Still tactic-focused** → disqualify

---

# **GLOBAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

✔ One question at a time  
 ✔ Silence is allowed  
 ✔ Never justify price  
 ✔ Never discount  
 ✔ Never “handle” emotionally  
 ✔ Never chase

---

# **FINAL CHECK (MANDATORY BEFORE CLOSE)**

Ask internally:

“Is this person structurally positioned to win?”

If **no**, ending the call is a success.

---

## **Next Step (Your Choice)**

When you’re ready, we can:

1. Turn this into a **one-page decision tree**

2. Add **exact phrasing for German market tone**

3. Build **call scoring \+ CRM tags per objection**

4. Create **closer training SOP**

Review this first — then tell me what to refine.

I want the sales call to be very standardized and so I would like you to create a PRD for me for a quick web app that I can build that I use cursor and I have developers so you don't have to dumb it down where I can basically have the entire sales call checklist inside of it and then basically each step can be checked off answers can be added into it and then if there's an objection at a certain stage the person can click on the objection and then as you have it in the flow there's certain outcomes and answers then these can be checked off so that the sales agent or who's ever doing the sales call really has some has a guideline to follow a standardized guideline that helps him also with with everything ask me any more questions if you need more clarity

Perfect use case for a **lightweight, high-leverage internal tool**.  
 Below is a **proper PRD**, written so your devs can build immediately in Cursor without hand-holding.

I’ll also flag **open decisions** at the end where I *do* need your input before final build.

---

# **PRD — Sales Call Orchestration & Objection Flow App**

**Working Name:** CallOS (rename later)  
 **Purpose:** Enforce decision-integrity sales calls through a standardized, checkable, objection-aware call flow.

---

## **1\. Problem Statement**

Sales calls currently rely on:

* memory

* experience

* improvisation

* individual closer skill variance

This leads to:

* inconsistency

* arguing objections

* emotional closes

* poor qualification

* weak post-call data

**Goal:**  
 Create a system that **guides**, **documents**, and **constrains** sales calls so every call:

* follows the same structure

* respects the “do not argue” principle

* produces clean decision outcomes

* generates structured data for optimization

---

## **2\. Core Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)**

* This app **does not persuade**

* It **diagnoses alignment**

* It **prevents arguing**

* It **enforces structure**

* It **protects the brand**

If a closer must “wing it”, the system has already failed.

---

## **3\. Target Users**

### **Primary**

* Sales closers

* Founders doing calls

* Implementation consultants who upsell

### **Secondary**

* Sales managers

* Ops / RevOps

* Coaching leadership

---

## **4\. Primary Use Case (Happy Path)**

1. Sales agent opens a **new call session**

2. Selects or creates a **prospect record**

3. The app walks them through:

   * predefined call milestones

   * mandatory questions

   * required confirmations

4. At any stage:

   * objections can be triggered

   * objection subflows appear

5. Each step:

   * can be checked off

   * can store notes

6. Call ends with:

   * enforced outcome classification

   * next steps

   * qualification status

---

## **5\. Functional Requirements**

---

### **5.1 Call Session Object**

Each call session must store:

* Prospect ID

* Date & time

* Sales agent

* Call type (Implementation / Coaching / Follow-up)

* Completion status

* Final outcome

---

### **5.2 Call Flow Engine**

The call is broken into **Milestones**.

Each milestone contains:

* Title

* Objective

* Required questions

* Required confirmations

* Optional notes

* Objection triggers (if applicable)

Milestones **must be sequential** (cannot skip).

---

## **6\. Core Milestones (Initial Version)**

### **M1 — Context & Frame**

* Confirm why they’re on the call

* Confirm what they bought (€495)

* Confirm expectations

**Required fields:**

* Reason for call (text)

* Confirmed expectation (checkbox)

---

### **M2 — Current State Mapping**

* Client count

* Current revenue structure

* Main pain points (Storno, instability, overload)

**Required fields:**

* Client count (number)

* Revenue volatility score (1–5)

* Main pain (multi-select)

---

### **M3 — Outcome Vision**

* What would “working” look like in 12 months?

* What would *not* changing cost them?

**Required fields:**

* Desired outcome (text)

* Cost of inaction (text)

---

### **M4 — System Reality Check**

* Manual effort required without automation

* Complexity acknowledgment

**Required confirmations:**

* “Understands implementation effort” (checkbox)

* “Acknowledges manual workload risk” (checkbox)

---

### **M5 — Solution Mapping**

* Show LeadTunnel system

* Explain leverage vs manual execution

**Required confirmations:**

* “Sees system leverage” (checkbox)

* “Understands scope” (checkbox)

---

### **M6 — Offer Presentation**

* Coaching structure

* Time horizon

* Payment structure

**Fields:**

* Price shown (auto)

* Payment plan selected

---

### **M7 — Decision Point**

* Explicit decision request

**Forced choice:**

* Proceed

* Pause

* Decline

---

## **7\. Objection System (Critical Feature)**

---

### **7.1 Objection Trigger**

At specific milestones, agent can click:

“Objection raised”

This opens an **Objection Selector**.

---

### **7.2 Objection Types (Initial Set)**

* Price

* Timing

* Capacity / Time

* Need to think

* Partner / Team

* Skepticism / Past failure

---

### **7.3 Objection Subflow Engine**

Each objection loads:

* Diagnostic questions (1–3 max)

* Mandatory response fields

* Outcome routing

**Important:**  
 Objection subflows **do not unlock persuasion copy**.

They only unlock:

* clarification

* alignment check

* disqualification

---

### **7.4 Objection Outcomes**

Each objection must end in **one** of:

* Resolved → continue call

* Deferred → schedule follow-up

* Disqualified → end call

Agent cannot proceed without selecting outcome.

---

## **8\. Guardrails (Anti-Arguing Controls)**

* No free-text persuasion scripts

* No “rebuttal” sections

* No discount fields

* No price editing

* Objection questions are **read-only**

This forces discipline.

---

## **9\. End-of-Call Enforcement**

At call end, agent must complete:

### **Outcome Classification (Required)**

* Coaching client

* Follow-up scheduled

* Implementation only

* Disqualified (not enough clients, etc.)

### **Qualification Flags**

* ≥500 clients ✔ / ✖

* Financial capacity ✔ / ✖

* Strategic alignment ✔ / ✖

---

## **10\. Data Model (High-Level)**

Entities:

* User (sales agent)

* Prospect

* CallSession

* Milestone

* MilestoneResponse

* Objection

* ObjectionResponse

* Outcome

Relational, audit-safe.

---

## **11\. Integrations (Phase 2+)**

Optional but planned:

* GoHighLevel contact sync

* Pipeline stage update

* Objection tagging

* Close reason analytics

* CRM write-back

---

## **12\. Non-Goals (Important)**

* ❌ No AI closing

* ❌ No chat bot

* ❌ No lead management

* ❌ No marketing automation

* ❌ No “improve conversion rate” gimmicks

This is a **decision system**, not a hype tool.

---

## **13\. Success Metrics**

* Reduced call variance

* Cleaner disqualification

* Higher coaching retention

* Shorter ramp time for closers

* Better objection analytics

---

## **14\. Open Questions (Need Your Input)**

Please answer these so we can finalize v1:

1. **Single-call or multi-call support?**  
    (e.g. Implementation call → Coaching call linked?)

2. **German language only or bilingual (DE/EN)?**

3. **Do you want call recording linked or just notes?**

4. **Should managers be able to review completed calls?**

5. **Do you want hard blocking if a milestone is skipped?**

6. **Is this internal-only or later client-facing (white-label potential)?**

---

Once you answer those, next steps can be:

* UX wireframe

* JSON schema for flows

* Objection flow config file

* Cursor-ready task breakdown

* Or a Supabase schema \+ API design

Just tell me how technical you want the next iteration.

Single-call or multi-call support? (e.g. Implementation call → Coaching call linked?) The implementation call includes the sales call too and includes a degree of value or coaching see our comveration where i explain how the call looks like. Add feature for follow up call though with calendar and appointment notes summary to pick up where left off in follow up, and should be stnchable to ghl calendar for that lead. 	2\.	German language only or bilingual (DE/EN)? German and english 	3\.	Do you want call recording linked or just notes? Call recordings and summary so ai can analyse and generate an analysis and recommendations or write follow up email sequence . 	4\.	Should managers be able to review completed calls? Yes, i will link it to my roi tool, it is multi tier admin, manager, and sales agent 	5\.	Do you want hard blocking if a milestone is skipped? Let's have a toggle for this. To be dynamic accirding to situation. 	6\.	Is this internal-only or later client-facing (white-label potential)? Yes, now internal and later potential white label

Great — your answers are clear. Below is the **updated, finalized PRD v1.1**, incorporating all decisions and extending it into a **build-ready specification** your devs can execute in Cursor.

I’ve **not repeated generic parts** unless they changed. This is a **delta-enhanced PRD**, not fluff.

---

# **PRD v1.1 — Sales Call Orchestration & Objection Flow App**

**Working Name:** CallOS  
 **Status:** Build-ready  
 **Scope:** Internal v1 → White-label capable v2

---

## **1\. Call Model (Updated)**

### **1.1 Call Type Architecture**

**Single-call core model** with **linked follow-ups**

* Primary call: **Implementation Call**

  * Includes:

    * value delivery

    * diagnosis

    * system mapping

    * coaching pitch

* Optional **Follow-up Call(s)**:

  * Linked to the same Prospect

  * Linked to the same Call Thread

  * Resume state from previous call

#### **Data Model Addition**

`CallThread {`  
  `id`  
  `prospectId`  
  `primaryCallId`  
  `followUpCallIds[]`  
`}`

---

## **2\. Follow-Up Call Feature (New)**

### **2.1 Follow-Up Creation**

From any call outcome:

* “Schedule Follow-Up” button

* Syncs with **GoHighLevel calendar** for that lead

### **2.2 Follow-Up Resume Logic**

On opening follow-up call:

* Show **previous call summary**

* Show:

  * last completed milestone

  * unresolved objections

  * open decision variables

  * qualification flags

* Allow agent to:

  * resume at a milestone

  * jump to decision (if appropriate)

---

## **3\. Language Support (Updated)**

### **3.1 Bilingual System (DE / EN)**

* Language toggle per user

* Language stored per call

* All milestones, objections, prompts stored as:

`{`  
  `"label": {`  
    `"de": "...",`  
    `"en": "..."`  
  `}`  
`}`

**Important:**  
 Language is **content-level**, not UI-only → white-label ready.

---

## **4\. Call Recording \+ AI Layer (New Critical Feature)**

### **4.1 Call Recording Integration**

Each CallSession supports:

* Upload / link recording (Zoom, GHL, manual)

* Timestamped markers per milestone

* Secure storage reference (not raw file if external)

---

### **4.2 AI Summary & Analysis Engine**

After call completion (or manually triggered):

**AI generates:**

* Call summary

* Decision integrity score

* Objection classification

* Risk flags (misalignment, overpromise, pressure)

* Coaching readiness score

**Outputs stored as structured objects**, not just text.

Example:

`AIAnalysis {`  
  `summary`  
  `keySignals[]`  
  `objectionTypes[]`  
  `recommendedNextAction`  
  `followUpEmailDraft`  
`}`

---

### **4.3 Follow-Up Email & Sequence Drafting**

From AI analysis:

* Generate:

  * single follow-up email

  * optional short sequence (2–4 emails)

* Human-in-the-loop:

  * editable

  * approve before send

* Can be pushed to GHL later (v1 optional, v2 native)

---

## **5\. Roles & Permissions (Expanded)**

### **5.1 Role Types**

| Role | Permissions |
| ----- | ----- |
| Sales Agent | Create & run calls, notes, objections |
| Manager | Review calls, analytics, AI output |
| Admin | Configure flows, milestones, objections |

---

### **5.2 ROI Tool Integration (Explicit)**

* CallOS links to **ROI Tool record**

* Managers can:

  * see projected ROI vs decision

  * compare promised vs structural fit

  * flag unrealistic expectations

This is **review-only**, not editable by agents.

---

## **6\. Milestone Blocking Logic (Toggle-Based)**

### **6.1 Blocking Modes**

Per call (or per user role):

* **Strict Mode** (default)

  * cannot skip milestones

* **Flexible Mode**

  * can jump with reason

  * logs override event

`MilestoneOverride {`  
  `milestoneId`  
  `reason`  
  `userId`  
  `timestamp`  
`}`

This allows:

* founder-level discretion

* edge cases

* auditability

---

## **7\. Objection System (Clarified & Locked)**

### **7.1 Objection Handling Philosophy (Enforced)**

* No persuasion copy

* No “overcoming”

* No price defense

* No emotional scripts

Objections remain **diagnostic-only**.

---

### **7.2 Objection State Persistence**

Unresolved objections:

* persist into follow-up calls

* must be explicitly closed or disqualified

---

## **8\. Call Outcomes (Final, Forced)**

At call end, agent must select:

### **8.1 Outcome Type**

* Coaching client (closed)

* Follow-up scheduled

* Implementation only

* Disqualified

### **8.2 Disqualification Reason (Required if applicable)**

* \<500 clients

* Cashflow mismatch

* Misaligned expectations

* Capacity constraint

* Authority issue

This feeds analytics and future targeting.

---

## **9\. Analytics & Manager View (New)**

Managers see:

* Calls per agent

* Objection frequency by type

* Close rate by qualification

* Time spent per milestone

* AI risk flags

**This is where optimization happens.**

---

## **10\. White-Label Readiness (Forward-Compatible)**

Design decisions made now to enable:

* tenant-based config

* custom milestone sets

* custom objection libraries

* branding later

No rebuild required.

---

## **11\. Out-of-Scope (Still)**

* No live AI co-pilot during calls

* No auto-closing

* No “best response suggestions”

This protects:

* integrity

* compliance

* brand trust

---

## **12\. Build Order (Suggested for Cursor)**

**Sprint 1**

* Data models

* Call flow engine

* Milestones UI

* Notes & checkmarks

**Sprint 2**

* Objection subflows

* Outcome enforcement

* Follow-up call linking

**Sprint 3**

* Call recording attach

* AI summary \+ analysis

* Manager dashboard

---

## **13\. Next Logical Step**

If you want, next we can:

1. Convert this PRD into **Cursor task breakdown**

2. Define **Milestone JSON config**

3. Define **Objection JSON config**

4. Design **minimal UI wireframe**

5. Draft **AI prompt pack** (VERY important)

Tell me which one you want next — this system is very well thought through, and you’re building the right thing.

It also needs to have the ability to have a client facing side and a sales rep facing control panel, for presentation modus where the sales call shows thebslides tonthe user when screen is shared in zoom. Ai can generate the slides. Simple text with a visualization, either info graphic or diagram depending. Nanno banana pro is good for this. And it should record the call like fathom records calls whe you add the link to fathom app.

Excellent addition. This **does not change** the architecture — it **completes it**.

Below is a **PRD v1.2 extension** that cleanly adds:

* client-facing presentation mode

* sales-rep control panel

* AI-generated slides

* call recording à la Fathom

* future white-label readiness

No fluff, build-ready.

---

# **PRD v1.2 — Presentation Mode, Client View & AI Slides**

## **0\. Why This Matters (Design Intent)**

This turns CallOS from:

“a checklist tool for closers”

into:

**a shared decision environment**  
 where:

* the rep controls the flow

* the client sees only what is relevant

* the system enforces structure

* AI supports clarity, not persuasion

This is **very aligned** with your philosophy.

---

## **1\. Dual-Interface Architecture (Core Addition)**

### **1.1 Two Distinct Interfaces**

#### **A) Sales Rep Control Panel**

Private, internal:

* full checklist

* objections

* notes

* qualification flags

* override toggles

* AI analysis

* recording controls

#### **B) Client Presentation View**

Shared via Zoom screen share:

* slides only

* no notes

* no objections

* no internal logic

* no qualification markers

Client never sees “sales mechanics”.

---

### **1.2 Technical Model**

`SessionView {`  
  `sessionId`  
  `mode: "REP" | "CLIENT"`  
  `activeSlideId`  
`}`

One session → two synchronized views.

---

## **2\. Presentation Mode (Live During Call)**

### **2.1 Activation**

Sales rep clicks:

**“Start Presentation Mode”**

This:

* opens client-facing slide view

* locks slide navigation to rep

* timestamps slides for call recording

---

### **2.2 Slide Progression Logic**

Slides are **bound to milestones**, not free-floating.

Example:

* M2 → “Current Situation”

* M4 → “Reality of Manual Implementation”

* M5 → “System Overview”

* M6 → “Coaching Structure”

Rep actions:

* Next / Previous slide

* Regenerate slide (AI)

* Annotate (optional later)

---

## **3\. AI-Generated Slides (Critical Feature)**

### **3.1 Slide Generation Trigger**

Slides can be generated:

* before the call (default templates)

* during the call (context-aware)

* after the call (follow-up deck)

---

### **3.2 Slide Content Rules (Important)**

Each slide:

* max **1 core idea**

* minimal text

* simple visualization

No:

* hype

* persuasion language

* emotional manipulation

---

### **3.3 AI Slide Input Context**

AI receives:

* current milestone

* client data (clients count, pain points)

* selected language (DE / EN)

* presentation tone (neutral / analytical)

Example input:

`{`  
  `"milestone": "System Reality Check",`  
  `"language": "de",`  
  `"clientContext": {`  
    `"clients": 640,`  
    `"mainPain": "Storno",`  
    `"manualProcesses": true`  
  `}`  
`}`

---

### **3.4 Visualization Engine**

* Uses **Nano Banana Pro**

* Visualization types:

  * flow diagram

  * comparison table

  * simple infographic

  * before/after schematic

AI selects type based on milestone.

---

## **4\. Slide Types (Initial Set)**

1. **Situation Mapping**

   * current state diagram

2. **Manual vs System**

   * comparison visualization

3. **10-Schritte Kundenplan Overview**

   * structured flow

4. **ROI Projection Snapshot**

   * simplified graph (fed by ROI tool)

5. **Coaching Structure**

   * timeline diagram (12 months)

---

## **5\. Call Recording System (Fathom-Style)**

### **5.1 Recording Activation**

Two options:

* Manual “Start Recording”

* Auto-record when call link detected

---

### **5.2 Fathom-Like Link-Based Recording**

Rep pastes Zoom link:

* system joins as silent recorder

* records audio \+ speaker detection

* timestamps:

  * milestones

  * objections

  * slide changes

---

### **5.3 Recording Metadata**

`Recording {`  
  `callSessionId`  
  `provider: "Zoom" | "Meet" | "Other"`  
  `transcript`  
  `timelineMarkers[]`  
`}`

---

## **6\. AI Post-Call Intelligence (Extended)**

From recording \+ slides:

AI generates:

* structured summary

* objection map

* decision readiness score

* follow-up email

* **client-facing recap deck**

* internal improvement notes

---

## **7\. Client-Facing Post-Call Assets**

After call, optionally send:

* recap email

* slide deck PDF

* next steps summary

Generated automatically, approved manually.

---

## **8\. Permission & Safety Model**

| Feature | Rep | Client |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Slides | Control | View |
| Notes | Edit | ❌ |
| Objections | View/Edit | ❌ |
| Recording | Control | ❌ |
| AI Analysis | View | ❌ |

This protects:

* compliance

* negotiation leverage

* system integrity

## **9\. White-Label Future (Still Compatible)**

Because:

* slide templates are config-based

* language is dynamic

* branding is abstracted

This can later become:

* a coaching product

* a sales OS

* a licensing model

---

## **10\. Updated Build Order**

### **Sprint 4 (New)**

* Dual-view sync

* Presentation mode

* Slide rendering

### **Sprint 5**

* Nano Banana Pro integration

* Recording bot

* AI slide generation

---

## **11\. Very Important Clarification (Design Principle)**

This is **not a pitch deck tool**.

It is a:

**guided, shared thinking surface**

The system:

* reduces cognitive load

* increases clarity

* removes pressure

* increases trust

That’s why it will outperform classic sales decks.

---

## **Next Steps (Pick One)**

1. Slide schema (JSON)

2. AI prompt pack for slide generation

3. UX wireframe (rep vs client view)

4. Recording \+ transcript pipeline design

5. Cursor task breakdown

Tell me which one you want next.

Letsbdo one by one. You generate one. Then stop and i say ok then you do the next

Perfect. We’ll do this **sequentially and controlled**.

---

# **STEP 1 — SLIDE SCHEMA (FOUNDATION)**

This is the **structural contract** between:

* sales logic

* presentation mode

* AI slide generation

* white-label future

Once this is right, everything else plugs in cleanly.

---

## **1\. Core Principle of the Slide System**

Slides are:

* **milestone-bound**, not free-form

* **context-aware**, not generic

* **single-idea**, not decks

* **presentation-only**, not sales logic

A slide is a **visual thinking aid**, not a persuasion artifact.

---

## **2\. Slide Object — Base Schema**

`Slide {`  
  `id: string`  
  `milestoneId: string`

  `language: "de" | "en"`

  `type:`   
    `| "text"`  
    `| "diagram"`  
    `| "comparison"`  
    `| "timeline"`  
    `| "chart"`

  `title: string`  
  `subtitle?: string`

  `coreMessage: string`

  `visualization?: VisualizationSpec`

  `generatedBy: "template" | "ai"`  
  `editable: boolean`

  `createdAt: timestamp`  
`}`

---

## **3\. Visualization Specification**

This is where **Nano Banana Pro** (or later engines) plug in.

`VisualizationSpec {`  
  `engine: "nano-banana-pro"`

  `visualType:`  
    `| "flow-diagram"`  
    `| "before-after"`  
    `| "stack"`  
    `| "timeline"`  
    `| "simple-chart"`  
    `| "matrix"`

  `data: Record<string, any>`

  `style: {`  
    `tone: "neutral" | "analytical"`  
    `complexity: "low"`  
  `}`  
`}`

---

## **4\. Milestone → Slide Mapping (Hard Rule)**

Each milestone can have:

* 0–3 slides max

* default \= 1

Example mapping:

`MilestoneSlideMap = {`  
  `M2: ["current-state-slide"],`  
  `M4: ["manual-reality-slide"],`  
  `M5: ["system-overview-slide"],`  
  `M6: ["coaching-structure-slide"]`  
`}`

No slide exists without a milestone.

---

## **5\. Example Slides (Concrete)**

### **Example 1 — Current Situation (M2)**

`{`  
  `"id": "slide-m2-current-state",`  
  `"milestoneId": "M2",`  
  `"language": "de",`  
  `"type": "diagram",`  
  `"title": "Ihre aktuelle Situation",`  
  `"coreMessage": "Ihr Einkommen hängt stark von einmaligen Abschlüssen ab.",`  
  `"visualization": {`  
    `"engine": "nano-banana-pro",`  
    `"visualType": "flow-diagram",`  
    `"data": {`  
      `"clients": 640,`  
      `"revenueType": "provisionsbasiert",`  
      `"risk": "Storno"`  
    `},`  
    `"style": {`  
      `"tone": "neutral",`  
      `"complexity": "low"`  
    `}`  
  `},`  
  `"generatedBy": "ai",`  
  `"editable": true`  
`}`

---

### **Example 2 — Manual vs System (M4)**

`{`  
  `"id": "slide-m4-manual-vs-system",`  
  `"milestoneId": "M4",`  
  `"language": "de",`  
  `"type": "comparison",`  
  `"title": "Manuelle Umsetzung vs. System",`  
  `"coreMessage": "Der Unterschied liegt nicht im Wissen – sondern in der Struktur.",`  
  `"visualization": {`  
    `"engine": "nano-banana-pro",`  
    `"visualType": "before-after",`  
    `"data": {`  
      `"manual": ["Excel", "E-Mails", "Einzelaufgaben"],`  
      `"system": ["Automationen", "CRM", "klarer Prozess"]`  
    `},`  
    `"style": {`  
      `"tone": "analytical",`  
      `"complexity": "low"`  
    `}`  
  `},`  
  `"generatedBy": "ai",`  
  `"editable": true`  
`}`

---

## **6\. Slide Lifecycle**

1. **Pre-generated templates** exist per milestone

2. AI can:

   * adapt text

   * adapt visualization data

   * switch language

3. Rep can:

   * regenerate

   * reorder (within milestone)

   * disable slide

4. Client sees **only rendered output**

---

## **7\. Guardrails (Important)**

* ❌ No CTA buttons on slides

* ❌ No pricing emphasis

* ❌ No scarcity language

* ❌ No testimonials on slides

Slides **explain**, they do not close.

---

## **8\. Why This Schema Works**

* Minimal but extensible

* AI-friendly

* White-label ready

* Analytics-ready (slide ↔ milestone ↔ objection)

* Works for live calls **and** post-call recap decks

---

### **STOP HERE**

Please review this **Slide Schema**.

Reply with:

* **“OK”** → we move to **Step 2: AI Prompt Pack for Slide Generation**

* or tell me what you want changed / added before proceeding

Important. The slides that are generated, even though there's a certain dynamic, need to be saved in a database and linked to the client ID. So we need to work with IDs so that the recording of how the sales agent executes the slides can get transcribed. And then later on, as more presentations and calls have been done, then a standardized and optimized version of the slide deck can then be created with an increasing degree of certainty of its effectiveness. So basically, because usually the problem is you create a slide deck, then you test it, and then it's the whole slide deck. But this way, during the whole process, while the slide is being presented and the recording will show the reaction of the customer and the way it has been presented by the agent. And so next time, if this worked good, then it can be checked off. And if it repeatedly works good, then it also can be checked off. Because we need to have a systematization, but also dynamically be able to iterate it towards functionality, because the sales call is such an important leverage in this whole system. And every percentage of improvement is a lot of money down the line, because this is where the whole profit is made. So it's really important that the slide deck isn't created 100% new each time. But basically, there is basically a process for – there are certain elements that get customized to the customer based on the information the customer gives. But the rest of the presentation has to be, in a way, static and only changes due to the iteration and the feedback from analysis, if that makes sense.

Excellent clarification — and you’re **100% right**. What you’re describing is the *missing layer* in almost all sales enablement systems.

You’re not building a slide generator.  
 You’re building a **learning sales system**.

Below is a **precise refinement** of Step 1 (Slide Schema), upgraded to support:

* persistence

* client linkage

* execution analysis

* iterative optimization

* convergence toward a “best-known” deck

This does **not** replace what we defined — it **extends it correctly**.

---

# **STEP 1 (REFINED) — PERSISTENT, ITERABLE SLIDE SYSTEM**

## **Core Insight (Lock This In)**

Slides are **versioned system components**, not disposable artifacts.

Each slide instance must be:

* identifiable

* replayable

* analyzable

* comparable across calls

This enables:

* agent performance analysis

* slide effectiveness scoring

* gradual standardization without freezing innovation

---

## **1\. Two-Level Slide Model (Critical Change)**

We must separate:

### **A) Slide Template (System-Level)**

Stable, evolving over time  
 Optimized via aggregate data

### **B) Slide Instance (Call-Level)**

Concrete execution in a specific call  
 Linked to client, agent, recording

This distinction is **non-negotiable**.

---

## **2\. Slide Template Schema (System Memory)**

`SlideTemplate {`  
  `templateId: string`  
  `milestoneId: string`

  `language: "de" | "en"`

  `type:`  
    `| "text"`  
    `| "diagram"`  
    `| "comparison"`  
    `| "timeline"`  
    `| "chart"`

  `titleTemplate: string`  
  `coreMessageTemplate: string`

  `visualizationTemplate: VisualizationSpecTemplate`

  `isCustomizable: boolean`  
  `customizableFields?: string[]`

  `status: "active" | "deprecated" | "experimental"`

  `effectivenessScore?: number`  
  `usageCount: number`  
  `lastUpdatedAt: timestamp`  
`}`

**Purpose:**

* This is the **canonical object**

* Improves over time

* Eventually converges toward “best known version”

---

## **3\. Slide Instance Schema (Call Execution)**

`SlideInstance {`  
  `slideInstanceId: string`

  `templateId: string`  
  `callSessionId: string`  
  `clientId: string`  
  `salesAgentId: string`

  `renderedContent: {`  
    `title: string`  
    `coreMessage: string`  
    `visualization: VisualizationSpec`  
  `}`

  `customizationData?: Record<string, any>`

  `presentedAt: timestamp`  
  `durationOnScreen: number`

  `recordingMarkers: {`  
    `startTime: number`  
    `endTime: number`  
  `}`

  `agentNotes?: string`

  `outcomeTag?: "positive" | "neutral" | "negative"`  
`}`

**This is the key object for learning.**

---

## **4\. Call Recording ↔ Slide Binding**

During recording:

* When slide is shown:

  * timestamp marker created

  * slideInstanceId attached

* Later:

  * transcript segments map to slideInstanceId

  * client reactions (verbal, pauses) can be analyzed per slide

This enables:

* “This slide worked when phrased like this”

* “This slide failed when rushed”

* “This visualization outperformed others”

---

## **5\. Customization Without Chaos (Your Exact Requirement)**

You are right:

*Not everything should be regenerated every time.*

### **Rule Set**

* **Template \= stable**

* **Instance \= personalized**

* **Customization is parameter-based**, not freeform

Example:

`customizationData: {`  
  `"clientCount": 640,`  
  `"mainPain": "Storno",`  
  `"currentTools": ["Excel", "Outlook"]`  
`}`

AI only fills **approved slots**.  
 Everything else stays identical.

This preserves:

* comparability

* learning

* systematization

---

## **6\. Iteration & Optimization Loop (This Is the Payoff)**

### **Step-by-step:**

1. SlideTemplate v1 is used

2. Many SlideInstances are created

3. Outcomes \+ recordings are analyzed

4. Patterns emerge:

   * phrasing

   * visualization

   * timing

5. Template is updated → v2

6. Old versions deprecated, not deleted

Over time:

The deck converges toward **maximum effectiveness**  
 without ever being “finished”

---

## **7\. Effectiveness Scoring (Later, but Designed Now)**

SlideTemplate can accumulate:

* close-rate correlation

* objection frequency after slide

* average on-screen duration

* agent success variance

Eventually:

`effectivenessScore = f(closeRate, objectionDrop, retention)`

This allows:

* evidence-based standardization

* removal of weak slides

* scaling what actually works

---

## **8\. Why This Solves the Classic Problem**

Traditional decks:

* static

* opaque

* all-or-nothing

* impossible to optimize granularly

Your system:

* atomic

* observable

* improvable

* compounding

This is **exactly** how you protect the profit center.

---

## **9\. Summary (In One Sentence)**

You are building:

**A versioned, data-backed sales presentation system that learns from every call and converges toward certainty without killing adaptability.**

That’s the right architecture.

---

### **STOP HERE**

Please confirm this refinement.

Reply with:

* **“OK”** → we move to **Step 2: AI Prompt Pack for Slide Generation (Template vs Instance aware)**

* or tell me precisely what to adjust before continuing

Continue to step 2\. However, note also that it's important that none of these parameters are hard-coded. There needs to be an admin section where the prompts can be adapted or changed or the milestones can be adapted and changed depending on whether we change it later or use it for other products and so on. But for now, it needs to be aligned, the starting point, to the precise sales call that I told you we're having in our objective.

Perfect. This is the **right moment** to lock Step 2 properly, because if we get this wrong, you hard-code dogma into the system instead of building a learning organism.

Below is **STEP 2 — AI PROMPT PACK ARCHITECTURE**, designed to be:

* ✅ admin-editable (no hard-coded prompts)

* ✅ product-agnostic

* ✅ milestone-driven

* ✅ template vs instance aware

* ✅ compatible with your exact current sales call

* ✅ future-proof for other offers / products

I’ll **only do Step 2 now** and then stop.

---

# **STEP 2 — AI PROMPT PACK (ADMIN-CONFIGURABLE)**

## **Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)**

**Prompts are configuration, not code.**

No prompt text lives in the codebase.  
 All prompts live in an **Admin Prompt Registry** and are versioned.

This allows:

* sales logic changes

* new products

* language changes

* iteration without redeploy

---

## **1\. Prompt System Architecture**

We split prompts into **4 layers**:

1. **Global System Prompts**

2. **Milestone Prompts**

3. **Slide Template Prompts**

4. **Post-Call Analysis Prompts**

Each layer is editable in Admin.

---

## **2\. Prompt Registry (Admin Data Model)**

`PromptConfig {`  
  `promptId: string`  
  `scope: "global" | "milestone" | "slide" | "analysis"`

  `relatedMilestoneId?: string`  
  `relatedSlideTemplateId?: string`

  `language: "de" | "en"`

  `promptText: string`

  `variables: string[]`

  `status: "active" | "deprecated" | "draft"`  
  `version: number`

  `updatedBy: adminId`  
  `updatedAt: timestamp`  
`}`

---

## **3\. Global System Prompt (Foundation)**

This defines the **behavioral rules** of the AI.

### **Example (DE – editable in Admin)**

`You are generating content for a structured, integrity-based sales system.`

`Rules:`  
`- Do NOT persuade or hype.`  
`- Do NOT argue objections.`  
`- Do NOT use scarcity, urgency, or manipulation.`  
`- Slides must explain, not sell.`  
`- One idea per slide.`  
`- Neutral, analytical tone.`  
`- Assume the client is a professional (financial advisor).`

`If information is missing, do not invent it.`

This prompt is:

* always injected

* always editable

* product-agnostic

---

## **4\. Milestone Prompt Layer (Key Logic)**

Each milestone has **its own prompt** defining:

* purpose of the milestone

* allowed content

* forbidden content

* contextual framing

### **Example — Milestone M4: *System Reality Check***

`Objective:`  
`Explain the reality of implementing the 10-Schritte-Kundenplan manually.`

`Context:`  
`The client is a financial advisor with {{clientCount}} clients.`  
`Main pain point: {{mainPain}}.`

`Rules:`  
`- Focus on workload, coordination, and consistency.`  
`- Do NOT exaggerate difficulty.`  
`- Do NOT imply failure without the system.`  
`- Show structural complexity, not emotional fear.`

Variables are resolved at runtime.

---

## **5\. Slide Template Prompt Layer (Template vs Instance Aware)**

This is where **customization is controlled**.

### **Slide Template Prompt Example**

`Generate a slide based on the following template:`

`Title (fixed intent): {{titleTemplate}}`  
`Core message intent: {{coreMessageTemplate}}`

`You may customize ONLY the following fields:`  
`{{customizableFields}}`

`Use the provided data:`  
`{{customizationData}}`

`Visualization type: {{visualType}}`

`Rules:`  
`- Do not change the intent.`  
`- Do not add new ideas.`  
`- Do not mention price.`

This ensures:

* structural consistency

* safe personalization

* comparability across calls

---

## **6\. Language Handling (Admin-Driven)**

Each prompt exists per language.

Admin can:

* edit German tone independently

* adapt English for different markets

* later add other languages

No translation at runtime unless explicitly enabled.

---

## **7\. Runtime Prompt Assembly (Very Important)**

When a slide is generated, the system assembles:

1. Global system prompt

2. Milestone prompt

3. Slide template prompt

4. Runtime variables (client data, language, product)

This **composite prompt** is logged and stored with the SlideInstance.

This gives you:

* full traceability

* reproducibility

* auditability

---

## **8\. Admin Control Panel (Functional Requirements)**

Admin must be able to:

* create / edit prompts

* version prompts

* activate / deactivate prompts

* assign prompts to:

  * milestones

  * slide templates

  * analysis stages

* preview prompt output

* rollback to previous versions

This is **mandatory** for white-label future.

---

## **9\. Alignment With Your Current Sales Call**

Initial prompt presets will be aligned to:

* Implementation \+ coaching hybrid call

* Financial advisors

* 10-Schritte-Kundenplan

* System vs manual contrast

* ROI realism (not hype)

* Long-term amortization logic

But **nothing is locked**.

---

## **10\. Why This Matters (Big Picture)**

This ensures:

* your sales philosophy is enforced by design

* iteration improves the system, not individual closers

* future products reuse the same engine

* the AI becomes a *force multiplier*, not a liability

You are not training salespeople.  
 You are training the **system itself**.

* **“OK”** → we proceed to **Step 3: UX & Interaction Model (Rep vs Client, live flow)**

* or tell me exactly what to adjust before moving on

Yeah, maybe I misunderstood this, but it seems like you're suggesting that the slides get generated in runtime. That would mean that every client, the slides would be different. I think that breaks standardization. We can have it that there's in settings, there's an option where it's like generation in runtime based on the best practice, but I think the slide deck needs to be, there needs to be one slide deck created for the, so the admin or the business puts in there, like I did now, records basically what they're going to go through in the sales call, what's important like we did, and then basically the slide deck needs to be created then once, and then that's the slide deck that's going to be used during the calls. And only in that slide deck, the information will be changed that applies to the customer. So let's say it says you have 520 clients, or it says you have 630 clients, or these are your main pain points, and things like that can be changed for the upcoming presentation, but the whole like psychological process of the slides should remain static so that that is systematized. You know, it's a sales process, so we can't change it all the time because that creates too much randomness and noise.

Perfect catch — and you’re **absolutely right**.  
 Thank you for stopping this here, because this distinction is *foundational*.

You are **not** building “AI-generated slides per call”.  
 You are building a **canonical, systematized sales deck with parameterized slots**.

What you want is:

**Standardization first.**  
 **Personalization only where structurally safe.**  
 **Iteration happens deliberately, not implicitly.**

Below is the **corrected and locked Step 2**, aligned exactly with that philosophy.

---

# **STEP 2 (CORRECTED) — CANONICAL SLIDE DECK \+ PARAMETERIZED INSTANCES**

## **Core Principle (This Replaces the Previous One)**

**The sales deck is generated once by the admin and then reused.**  
 **AI does not improvise the sales psychology at runtime.**

AI’s role is:

* creation (admin phase)

* iteration (analysis phase)

AI’s role is **not**:

* runtime persuasion

* per-client narrative changes

This preserves:

* signal

* comparability

* learning

* system integrity

---

## **1\. Three Distinct Phases (Important Mental Model)**

### **PHASE A — Deck Creation (Admin / Design Time)**

* Happens rarely

* Intentional

* Versioned

* High leverage

### **PHASE B — Deck Execution (Sales Call Runtime)**

* No AI creativity

* Only parameter substitution

* Fully standardized flow

### **PHASE C — Deck Iteration (Post-Analysis)**

* Based on data

* Controlled changes

* New version rollout

---

## **2\. Canonical Slide Deck Model (System-Level)**

Instead of “runtime generation”, we define:

`SlideDeck {`  
  `deckId: string`  
  `productId: string`

  `language: "de" | "en"`

  `version: number`  
  `status: "active" | "draft" | "deprecated"`

  `milestoneOrder: string[]   // enforced psychological flow`

  `slideTemplateIds: string[]`

  `createdBy: adminId`  
  `createdAt: timestamp`  
`}`

This is **the sales process**, encoded.

---

## **3\. Slide Template (Static Psychology)**

Each slide template contains:

* fixed narrative intent

* fixed structure

* **explicit parameter slots**

`SlideTemplate {`  
  `templateId: string`  
  `milestoneId: string`

  `titleStatic: string`  
  `coreMessageStatic: string`

  `parameterSlots: {`  
    `key: string`  
    `type: "number" | "string" | "enum"`  
    `required: boolean`  
  `}[]`

  `visualizationTemplate: VisualizationSpecTemplate`

  `editableByAdminOnly: true`  
`}`

### **Example**

`{`  
  `"titleStatic": "Ihre aktuelle Ausgangssituation",`  
  `"coreMessageStatic":`   
    `"Mit {{clientCount}} bestehenden Kunden liegt Ihr größtes Risiko nicht im Neugeschäft, sondern in der Stabilität Ihrer Einnahmen.",`  
  `"parameterSlots": [`  
    `{ "key": "clientCount", "type": "number", "required": true }`  
  `]`  
`}`

👉 **Narrative stays the same.**  
 **Only the numbers change.**

---

## **4\. Runtime Execution (Sales Call)**

At call time:

* SlideDeck vX is loaded

* SlideTemplates are rendered

* Parameters are injected from:

  * discovery answers

  * CRM data

  * call inputs

`SlideInstance {`  
  `slideInstanceId`  
  `templateId`  
  `callSessionId`

  `resolvedParameters: {`  
    `clientCount: 630`  
  `}`

  `renderedContent  // deterministic output`  
`}`

**No AI creativity here.**  
 **No psychological drift.**

---

## **5\. Where AI Actually Lives (Correct Placement)**

### **5.1 AI in Deck Creation (Admin Mode)**

Admin uses AI to:

* draft initial deck

* refine wording

* design visualizations

* propose variants

But:

* admin approves

* version is frozen

* deck becomes canonical

---

### **5.2 AI in Post-Call Analysis (Learning Mode)**

AI analyzes:

* recordings

* slide timing

* objections after slide X

* close correlation

Then suggests:

* “Slide 4 wording causes confusion”

* “Slide 6 too early”

* “Visualization A outperforms B”

Admin decides whether to:

* update deck → v+1

* keep as is

---

## **6\. Optional: Controlled Experiment Mode (Advanced, Off by Default)**

You *can* later add:

* **A/B slide variants**

* limited to admin-approved alternatives

* statistically evaluated

But still:

* no per-call improvisation

* no uncontrolled randomness

---

## **7\. Why Your Instinct Is Correct (Important)**

If slides change every call:

* you lose signal

* you can’t learn

* you can’t train

* you can’t scale

Your approach:

* turns sales into an **engineering problem**

* allows marginal gains to compound

* protects the profit center

This is exactly how high-stakes systems should be built.

---

## **8\. Summary (One Sentence)**

**The sales deck is a versioned system artifact;**  
 **AI helps design and improve it — not reinterpret it live.**

We are now fully aligned.

At this point, we've discussed a lot. I need you to do the following, no matter how extensive it is. I need you to create a summary following, like, containing all of the features that we just spoke about. Short principle, and then the feature, so that I have a feature overview of the whole system.

Got it. Below is a **complete, structured feature overview** of the system we designed together — distilled, explicit, and **implementation-ready**.

This is **not a PRD** and **not marketing copy**.  
 It’s a **system feature map** you can use to align devs, stakeholders, and yourself.

---

# **SYSTEM OVERVIEW — SALES CALL OPERATING SYSTEM (CallOS)**

## **SYSTEM PURPOSE (ONE SENTENCE)**

A standardized, integrity-based sales call operating system that **guides execution**, **records reality**, and **learns over time**, without relying on persuasion or improvisation.

---

# **CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

1. **Standardization before optimization**  
    → No improvisation at runtime. Learn first, then iterate deliberately.

2. **Diagnosis over persuasion**  
    → The system never argues objections. It checks alignment.

3. **Single source of truth**  
    → Sales logic, slides, objections, and outcomes are system-encoded.

4. **Versioned learning system**  
    → Every call improves the system, not just the agent.

5. **Separation of concerns**  
    → Rep view ≠ Client view ≠ Admin view.

6. **Admin-configurable, not hard-coded**  
    → Everything that can change lives in settings, not code.

---

# **FEATURE OVERVIEW (BY SYSTEM AREA)**

---

## **1\. CALL FLOW ENGINE (CORE)**

**Principle:**  
 Sales calls must follow a defined psychological and logical sequence.

**Features:**

* Milestone-based call structure

* Enforced milestone order (with optional override)

* Each milestone has:

  * objective

  * required questions

  * confirmations

  * notes

  * objection triggers

* Toggle between:

  * **Strict mode** (no skipping)

  * **Flexible mode** (override with reason)

---

## **2\. SINGLE-CALL \+ FOLLOW-UP SUPPORT**

**Principle:**  
 The implementation call is the sales call — but reality requires follow-ups.

**Features:**

* Primary call (implementation \+ sales)

* Linked follow-up calls

* Resume context:

  * last milestone

  * unresolved objections

  * decision blockers

* Follow-ups synced with:

  * GoHighLevel calendar

  * appointment notes

* Full call thread history per prospect

---

## **3\. ROLE-BASED ACCESS (MULTI-TIER)**

**Principle:**  
 Different roles need different visibility and control.

**Roles:**

* Sales Agent

* Manager

* Admin

**Features:**

* Sales Agent:

  * runs calls

  * sees checklist

  * triggers objections

* Manager:

  * reviews calls

  * sees AI analysis

  * links to ROI tool

* Admin:

  * edits milestones

  * edits slides

  * edits prompts

  * manages versions

---

## **4\. DUAL INTERFACE SYSTEM (CRITICAL)**

### **A) Sales Rep Control Panel**

**Principle:**  
 The rep controls the system — the client never sees mechanics.

**Features:**

* Full checklist

* Notes & confirmations

* Objection subflows

* Recording controls

* Slide navigation

* AI insights (post-call)

---

### **B) Client Presentation View**

**Principle:**  
 Client sees only structured clarity, not sales logic.

**Features:**

* Presentation-only slides

* No notes, no objections, no scoring

* Controlled by rep

* Used via Zoom screen share

* Synced live with rep actions

---

## **5\. CANONICAL SLIDE DECK SYSTEM (KEY)**

 The sales deck is a **system artifact**, not recreated per call.

**Features:**

* One canonical slide deck per product

* Versioned (v1, v2, v3…)

* Bound to milestones

* Fixed psychological flow

* No runtime narrative changes

---

## **6\. PARAMETERIZED SLIDES (SAFE PERSONALIZATION)**

  * client count

  * pain points

  * numbers

* Narrative stays fixed

* Only approved parameters change

* Deterministic rendering per call

---

## **7\. SLIDE TEMPLATE vs SLIDE INSTANCE MODEL**

**Principle:**  
 Separate system knowledge from execution data.

  * pasted Zoom link

  * system joins silently

* Audio \+ transcript

* Speaker detection

* Timeline markers for:

  * milestones

  * objections

  * slide changes

* Recording linked to:

  * call session

  * slide instances

---

## **10\. AI POST-CALL ANALYSIS (NOT LIVE)**

**Principle:**  
 AI evaluates — it does not influence live decisions.

**Features:**

* Call summary

* Objection classification

* Decision readiness score

* Risk flags

* Agent execution feedback

* Slide effectiveness signals

* Suggested follow-up email / sequence

* Suggested deck improvements (admin-reviewed)

---

## **11\. OBJECTION SYSTEM (DIAGNOSTIC ONLY)**

**Principle:**  
 Objections are signals, not resistance.

**Features:**

* Objection types:

  * price

  * timing

  * capacity

  * thinking

  * partner

  * skepticism

* Each objection:

  * opens a diagnostic subflow

  * limited questions

  * no persuasion text

* Forced outcome:

  * resolved

  * deferred

  * disqualified

* Unresolved objections persist into follow-ups

---

## **12\. OUTCOME ENFORCEMENT**

**Principle:**  
 Every call must end with a clean decision.

**Features:**

* Forced outcome selection:

  * coaching client

  * follow-up

  * implementation only

  * disqualified

* Mandatory disqualification reason

* Admin-editable

* Logged per execution

---

## **15\. BILINGUAL SYSTEM (DE / EN)**

**Principle:**  
 Language is content, not UI.

**Features:**

* Language per call

* Language per slide

* Language per prompt

* No runtime translation unless enabled

---

# **ONE-LINE SUMMARY**

**This system turns sales from an art into an engineered, learning, versioned operating system — without sacrificing human judgment.**

If you want, next we can:

* convert this into a **one-page system diagram**

* translate it into a **Cursor task backlog**

* or formalize it into a **technical architecture doc**

Tell me what you want next.

I just had an idea of how we can do the visual, the presentation mode. So the app, since it's a web app, when it goes into presentation, a new tab is opened. And then in Zoom, you can share just a tab. And that way, the presentation, what the customer sees is just that part inside of that tab. And then the sales agent can see his dashboard view or his view where he can check stuff off, add notes and stuff like that during the sales call.

Yes — that’s a **very good** idea.  
 And more importantly: it’s **the correct architectural decision**.

What you just described cleanly solves **focus, separation, and control** in one move.

I’ll break this down in a **systems way**, not fluffy UX talk.

---

## **WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT DESIGN (PRINCIPLE LEVEL)**

### **1\. Hard separation of realities**

* **Client reality:** clarity, visuals, calm

* **Sales reality:** logic, checkpoints, decisions, notes

Mixing those in one screen is a cognitive leak.  
 Your idea prevents that completely.

---

### **2\. Zero-leak presentation**

By sharing **only one browser tab**:

* No accidental UI exposure

* No notes

* No objections

* No checklists

* No AI hints

* No system mechanics

This preserves **authority and trust**.

---

### **3\. Sales agent stays operational**

The agent:

* keeps full control

* checks milestones

* logs answers

* triggers objections

* sees AI hints (if enabled)

…without the client ever knowing this system exists.

This is *exactly* how professional operating systems work (think: pilots).

---

## **HOW THIS WORKS (CONCRETE FLOW)**

### **Presentation Mode Activation**

1. Sales agent clicks **“Start Presentation Mode”**

2. System:

   * opens a **new browser tab**

   * loads a **presentation-only route**

3. This route:

   * has **no auth-sensitive UI**

   * is **client-safe**

   * is **read-only**

4. Agent shares **only that tab** in Zoom

---

## **TAB ARCHITECTURE (IMPORTANT)**

### **Tab 1 — Sales Control Panel**

Visible only to agent.

Contains:

* Call checklist

* Milestones

* Objection triggers

* Notes

* Qualification flags

* Recording status

* Slide control buttons

### **Tab 2 — Presentation View**

Visible to client via Zoom tab sharing.

Contains:

* Slides only

* Visuals

* Numbers

* Diagrams

* No controls

* No system text

* No notes

---

## **SYNCHRONIZATION MODEL**

This is the critical part.

* Sales Control Panel is the **source of truth**

* Presentation Tab is a **slave view**

When the agent:

* advances milestone → slide changes

* updates parameter → number updates

* triggers section → visual updates

All updates are:

* pushed via state sync (WebSocket / pub-sub)

* timestamped

* logged

---

## **WHY THIS IS EVEN BETTER THAN “PRESENTATION MODE UI”**

Most apps try to do:

“presentation mode toggle”

That still runs in the same DOM and context.

Your approach:

* different route

* different permissions

* different rendering tree

This is:

* safer

* cleaner

* scalable

* white-label ready

---

## **DATA & RECORDING ADVANTAGE (VERY IMPORTANT)**

Because slides live in a **separate tab**:

* you can log:

  * exact slide shown

  * time on slide

  * objections triggered while slide active

* recordings can be aligned to:

  * slide timeline

  * milestone timeline

This is **gold** for later optimization.

---

## **SECURITY & WHITE-LABEL BENEFIT**

Later, when white-labeling:

* presentation tab can live on:

  * client-specific domain

* control panel stays internal

* zero risk of system exposure

---

## **FINAL VERDICT**

What you just proposed is:

✅ technically sound  
 ✅ UX-clean  
 ✅ sales-psychology safe  
 ✅ future-proof  
 ✅ white-label compatible  
 ✅ optimization-friendly

I would lock this in as:

**Canonical Presentation Architecture**

---

### **NEXT STEP (YOU DECIDE)**

We continue **one by one**, as requested.

Do you want next:

1. **Data model (IDs, sessions, slides, calls)**

2. **Routing & permissions design**

3. **State synchronization logic**

4. **PRD section for “Presentation Mode” only**

Say the number.

Let's work on the prompts for the AI engine.

Perfect. We’ll do this **systematically** and **modular**, not as one giant “AI prompt”.

Below is a **Prompt Architecture Blueprint** for your AI engine, aligned with everything we defined.  
 This is the *governing layer* — not implementation code yet.

I’ll give you **Prompt Layer 1** now.  
 Then I’ll stop.  
 You say **“OK”**, and we move to the next layer.

---

# **AI PROMPT SYSTEM — OVERALL PHILOSOPHY**

**AI is not a seller.**  
 AI is a **silent analyst, synthesizer, and documentation engine**.

AI must:

* never persuade live

* never improvise sales logic

* never override the system

* never hallucinate structure

AI only:

* prepares

* observes

* analyzes

* summarizes

* suggests (admin-only)

---

# **PROMPT ARCHITECTURE (OVERVIEW)**

The system uses **prompt scopes**, not one prompt.

1. **Global System Prompt** ✅ (we do this now)

2. Milestone-Level Prompts

3. Objection Subflow Prompts

4. Slide Effectiveness Analysis Prompts

5. Call Summary & Follow-up Prompts

6. Admin Iteration Prompts (deck improvement)

7. Manager Review Prompts

---

# **PROMPT LAYER 1 — GLOBAL SYSTEM PROMPT (FOUNDATION)**

This prompt is **always loaded**.  
 All other prompts are **children** of this one.

---

## **🔒 GLOBAL SYSTEM PROMPT (MASTER)**

### **Purpose**

Defines the *identity, limits, ethics, and behavior* of the AI across the entire app.

---

### **SYSTEM PROMPT — VERSION v1.0**

`You are an analytical assistant inside a standardized sales call operating system.`

`Your role is NOT to sell, persuade, convince, or overcome objections.`

`Your role is to:`  
`- observe structured conversations`  
`- analyze alignment between the prospect and the offer`  
`- summarize facts, signals, and risks`  
`- document decisions and reasoning`  
`- support standardization and learning`

`You must strictly follow these rules:`

`1. You do NOT generate persuasive language for live sales calls.`  
`2. You do NOT argue objections or suggest rebuttals.`  
`3. You do NOT invent benefits, guarantees, or urgency.`  
`4. You do NOT deviate from the defined call structure.`  
`5. You do NOT alter the psychological order of the sales process.`  
`6. You do NOT provide advice directly to prospects.`  
`7. You do NOT optimize for closing at all costs.`

`You MAY:`  
`- summarize what was said`  
`- classify objections`  
`- assess readiness and fit`  
`- identify missing information`  
`- highlight inconsistencies`  
`- generate neutral follow-up summaries`  
`- propose system improvements (admin review only)`

`Your outputs must always be:`  
`- factual`  
`- neutral`  
`- structured`  
`- traceable to evidence in the call`  
`- clearly separated between observation and suggestion`

`If information is missing or uncertain, you must explicitly say so.`

`If a prospect is misaligned with the offer, you must flag it clearly.`

`Your primary objective is system integrity and long-term learning, not short-term conversion.`

---

## **WHY THIS PROMPT IS CRITICAL**

This prompt ensures:

* ❌ No “AI sales bro”

* ❌ No improvisation

* ❌ No manipulative language

* ❌ No accidental coaching of the rep mid-call

And enforces:

* ✅ ethical sales

* ✅ clean qualification

* ✅ repeatable analysis

* ✅ scalable optimization

---

## **SYSTEM FLAGS CONTROLLED BY ADMIN (NOT AI)**

The AI **must respect** these flags:

* `language`: DE / EN

* `strict_mode`: true / false

* `live_ai_enabled`: false (default)

* `analysis_depth`: low / medium / high

* `suggestions_allowed`: admin-only

---

## **OUTPUT FORMAT RULE (GLOBAL)**

All AI outputs must follow this structure:

`SECTION: [Observation | Summary | Risk | Alignment | Suggestion]`

`- Bullet points only`  
`- No rhetorical language`  
`- No emotional framing`  
`- No persuasion`

---

## **HARD FAIL CONDITIONS (AI MUST REFUSE)**

AI must refuse or return a warning if asked to:

* write sales scripts

* handle objections live

* persuade the prospect

* promise outcomes

* modify the call flow

* bypass qualification criteria

---

### **STATUS**

✅ Global Prompt Defined  
 ✅ System Ethics Locked  
 ✅ Guardrails Installed

---

### **NEXT STEP (YOU DECIDE)**

Say **“OK”**, and I will generate **Prompt Layer 2**:

➡ **Milestone-Level Prompts**  
 (what the AI does at *each stage* of the call)

We will do this **one layer at a time**, exactly as you asked.

And remember, values are not hard-coded into the prompts. They are variables in the prompts. The actual custom fields and information live in the admin panel that takes the information from the sales agent's input.

Perfect — that’s an **important correction**, and you’re 100% right.  
 Let’s lock this in **properly** before moving on.

Below is the **corrected and finalized version of Prompt Layer 1**, rewritten so that **nothing is hard-coded** and **all values are injected as variables from the admin panel / call state**.

This becomes the **canonical master prompt template**.

---

# **AI PROMPT SYSTEM — GLOBAL MASTER PROMPT (VARIABLE-DRIVEN)**

## **DESIGN RULE (LOCKED)**

**Prompts define behavior.**  
 **Data defines content.**  
 **Admin defines truth.**

The AI never owns values.  
 It only consumes **structured variables**.

---

## **VARIABLE SOURCES (IMPORTANT)**

All variables are injected at runtime from:

* Admin configuration

* Sales agent inputs

* Call session state

* Pipeline data (GHL)

* Slide / milestone definitions

AI **must not infer missing values**.

---

# **GLOBAL SYSTEM PROMPT — TEMPLATE v1.1 (VARIABLE-BASED)**

`You are an analytical assistant operating inside a standardized sales call system.`

`System context:`  
`- Product: {{product_name}}`  
`- Call type: {{call_type}}`  
`- Language: {{language}}`  
`- Strict mode: {{strict_mode}}`  
`- Qualification criteria: {{qualification_criteria}}`  
`- Sales philosophy: {{sales_philosophy}}`

`Your role is NOT to sell, persuade, convince, or close.`

`Your role is to:`  
`- observe a structured conversation`  
`- analyze alignment between the prospect and the offer`  
`- summarize verified facts from the call`  
`- classify signals, objections, and risks`  
`- document decisions and reasoning`  
`- support system learning and optimization`

`You must strictly follow these constraints:`

`1. You do NOT generate persuasive or sales-oriented language.`  
`2. You do NOT argue objections or suggest rebuttals.`  
`3. You do NOT invent benefits, guarantees, urgency, or outcomes.`  
`4. You do NOT change the call flow or milestone order.`  
`5. You do NOT override qualification rules defined by {{qualification_criteria}}.`  
`6. You do NOT provide advice to the prospect.`  
`7. You do NOT optimize for closing at the expense of fit.`

`You MAY:`  
`- summarize what was explicitly stated`  
`- identify missing or inconsistent information`  
`- classify objections using {{objection_taxonomy}}`  
`- assess readiness using {{readiness_framework}}`  
`- flag misalignment with {{offer_constraints}}`  
`- generate neutral follow-up summaries`  
`- suggest system improvements for admin review only`

`All outputs must be:`  
`- factual`  
`- neutral`  
`- structured`  
`- traceable to call evidence`  
`- explicitly scoped (observation vs inference vs suggestion)`

`If information is missing, output:`  
`“Information not available based on current inputs.”`

`If a prospect does not meet qualification requirements, flag this clearly.`

`Your primary objective is:`  
`{{primary_system_objective}}`

`You operate under the governance of:`  
`{{governance_policy}}`

---

## **STANDARDIZED OUTPUT FORMAT (VARIABLE-CONTROLLED)**

`OUTPUT_FORMAT:`  
`- Sections: {{allowed_sections}}`  
`- Bullet points only`  
`- No rhetorical language`  
`- No emotional framing`  
`- No assumptions beyond provided data`

---

## **HARD FAIL RULES (VARIABLE-AWARE)**

AI must refuse or return a warning if asked to:

* generate sales scripts outside {{allowed\_ai\_actions}}

* handle objections live when {{live\_ai\_enabled}} \= false

* bypass qualification logic defined in {{qualification\_criteria}}

* modify milestones defined in {{milestone\_schema}}

---

## **WHY THIS MATTERS (SYSTEMICALLY)**

This guarantees:

* ✅ Full admin control

* ✅ Product-agnostic reuse

* ✅ White-label readiness

* ✅ No prompt rewrites when offers change

* ✅ No logic drift over time

* ✅ Clean separation of **system logic** vs **business data**

You can:

* reuse this for other offers

* reuse it for other verticals

* reuse it for white-label clients  
   by changing **only admin variables**, not prompts.

---

## **STATUS CHECK**

✅ No hard-coded values  
 ✅ All business logic injected  
 ✅ Prompts are reusable templates  
 ✅ Admin panel is the source of truth

---

### **NEXT STEP (ONE BY ONE, AS REQUESTED)**

If you say **“OK”**, I will continue with:

➡ **Prompt Layer 2: Milestone-Level Prompts**  
 (each milestone has its own scoped analytical behavior)

I will stop again after that.

Ok

Perfect.  
 We now move to **PROMPT LAYER 2: Milestone-Level Prompts**.

As requested: **one step only**, then I stop.

---

# **AI PROMPT SYSTEM — LAYER 2**

## **MILESTONE-LEVEL PROMPTS (VARIABLE-DRIVEN)**

---

## **PURPOSE OF LAYER 2 (VERY IMPORTANT)**

Layer 2 **does NOT** replace Layer 1\.  
 It **inherits** Layer 1 and **adds scoped behavior** per milestone.

Think of it as:

* Layer 1 → Constitution / Law

* Layer 2 → Role instructions per phase of the call

This ensures:

* strict standardization

* zero improvisation drift

* analyzable, repeatable sales behavior

---

## **CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES**

1. **One milestone \= one prompt**

2. **No milestone may override global rules**

3. **Milestone logic is configurable in admin**

4. **Milestones can be reused across products**

5. **Milestones produce structured outputs only**

---

## **MILESTONE PROMPT TEMPLATE (CANONICAL)**

This is the **base template** used for *every* milestone.

`You are now operating within the milestone:`  
`{{milestone_id}} — {{milestone_name}}`

`Milestone purpose:`  
`{{milestone_purpose}}`

`Milestone success criteria:`  
`{{milestone_success_criteria}}`

`Required inputs for this milestone:`  
`{{required_inputs}}`

`Disallowed actions during this milestone:`  
`{{disallowed_actions}}`

`Qualification relevance:`  
`{{qualification_relevance}}`

`Your task:`  
`- Observe the interaction during this milestone`  
`- Validate whether required inputs were collected`  
`- Detect inconsistencies or gaps`  
`- Classify signals according to {{signal_framework}}`  
`- Flag risks according to {{risk_framework}}`  
`- Determine milestone status:`  
  `{{allowed_milestone_states}}`

`You must NOT:`  
`- persuade`  
`- argue objections`  
`- change topic`  
`- advance to the next milestone`  
`- summarize future steps`

`Output only using:`  
`{{milestone_output_schema}}`

`If milestone requirements are incomplete:`  
`Return status = "INCOMPLETE"`  
`and specify missing inputs explicitly.`

---

## **EXAMPLE — MILESTONE 1**

### **“Context & Frame Alignment”**

(This is **example content**, NOT hard-coded — values live in admin.)

`{{milestone_id}}: M1`  
`{{milestone_name}}: Context & Frame Alignment`

`{{milestone_purpose}}:`  
`Establish shared understanding of call scope, intent, and boundaries.`

`{{milestone_success_criteria}}:`  
`- Prospect confirms understanding of call structure`  
`- Prospect agrees to exploratory (not advisory) nature`  
`- Time expectations are acknowledged`

`{{required_inputs}}:`  
`- Confirmation of call purpose`  
`- Time availability`  
`- Agreement to exploratory frame`

`{{disallowed_actions}}:`  
`- Presenting offers`  
`- Discussing pricing`  
`- Providing advice`

`{{qualification_relevance}}:`  
`Low (contextual only)`

`{{allowed_milestone_states}}:`  
`- COMPLETE`  
`- INCOMPLETE`  
`- RESISTANCE`

`{{milestone_output_schema}}:`  
`- Confirmed scope (yes/no)`  
`- Time confirmed (yes/no)`  
`- Resistance signals (if any)`  
`- Notes (verbatim only)`

---

## **HOW THIS IS USED IN THE APP**

* Each milestone loads:

  * its own prompt

  * its own checklist

  * its own AI observer

* Sales agent:

  * checks items

  * enters notes

* AI:

  * validates completeness

  * flags risks

  * stores structured outputs

* Manager:

  * reviews milestone-by-milestone performance

---

## **WHY THIS IS CRITICAL**

This enables:

* 🎯 Call standardization at **micro level**

* 📊 Milestone-specific analytics

* 🧠 Later pattern recognition (what milestones fail?)

* 🔁 Controlled iteration without chaos

* 🔒 No rogue sales behavior

---

## **WHAT WE HAVE NOW**

✅ Global AI constitution (Layer 1\)  
 ✅ Milestone-scoped AI logic (Layer 2\)  
 ✅ Fully variable-driven  
 ✅ Admin-configurable  
 ✅ Product-agnostic

---

### **STOP POINT**

Say **“OK”** and I will continue with:

➡ **Prompt Layer 3: Objection Subflow Prompts (Non-Argumentative)**  
 (where we resolve your earlier paradox cleanly)

I will stop again after that.

Ok

Excellent.  
 Now we move to **PROMPT LAYER 3: Objection Subflow Prompts**.

This layer resolves the **apparent contradiction** you correctly identified earlier:

“How can we have objection subflows if we explicitly say: *Do NOT argue objections*?”

This layer is the **answer**.

I will deliver **only Layer 3**, then stop.

---

# **AI PROMPT SYSTEM — LAYER 3**

## **OBJECTION SUBFLOW PROMPTS (NON-ARGUMENTATIVE)**

---

## **FIRST: THE PRINCIPLE (LOCK THIS IN)**

**Objections are not something to defeat.**  
 **They are signals to classify.**

So:

* ❌ No rebuttals

* ❌ No persuasion

* ❌ No counter-arguments

Instead:

* ✅ Clarification

* ✅ Validation

* ✅ Categorization

* ✅ Fit assessment

This preserves:

* trust

* standardization

* long-term conversion quality

* analyzable data

---

## **WHAT AN “OBJECTION SUBFLOW” ACTUALLY IS**

An objection subflow is **NOT** a sales response.

It is a **diagnostic micro-flow** that answers one question:

*“What kind of signal is this objection?”*

---

## **OBJECTION TYPES (ADMIN-DEFINED)**

These are **examples** only — taxonomy lives in admin:

`{{objection_taxonomy}}:`  
`- Timing`  
`- Price`  
`- Trust`  
`- Authority`  
`- Capacity`  
`- Priority`  
`- Skepticism`  
`- External constraints`  
`- Misunderstanding`

AI never invents categories.

---

## **WHEN A SUBFLOW IS TRIGGERED**

A subflow is triggered when:

* Agent flags an objection manually  
   OR

* AI detects objection language above {{objection\_threshold}}

---

## **OBJECTION SUBFLOW PROMPT — CANONICAL TEMPLATE**

`You are now handling an objection subflow.`

`Detected objection:`  
`{{objection_text}}`

`Objection category (pre-classified or AI-suggested):`  
`{{objection_category}}`

`Current milestone:`  
`{{current_milestone}}`

`Your role:`  
`- Do NOT argue or resolve the objection`  
`- Do NOT persuade`  
`- Do NOT defend the offer`

`Your task is to:`  
`1. Clarify the objection meaning (if ambiguous)`  
`2. Validate the objection emotionally (neutral validation only)`  
`3. Determine whether the objection indicates:`  
   `- lack of information`  
   `- lack of trust`  
   `- lack of fit`  
   `- lack of readiness`  
   `- external constraint`  
`4. Assess whether this objection blocks progression under:`  
   `{{qualification_criteria}}`

`Allowed outputs:`  
`- Clarifying question suggestions (neutral)`  
`- Classification result`  
`- Risk level`  
`- Recommendation for next action (process-level only)`

`Disallowed outputs:`  
`- Rebuttals`  
`- Persuasive framing`  
`- Closing language`  
`- Guarantees`  
`- Comparisons`

`Output format:`  
`{{objection_output_schema}}`

---

## **EXAMPLE SUBFLOW (CONCRETE, NOT HARD-CODED)**

### **Objection:**

“I need to think about it.”

AI does NOT respond with:

* urgency

* scarcity

* logic traps

* “what’s stopping you?”

Instead, AI classifies:

`Classification:`  
`- Category: Timing`  
`- Type: Readiness uncertainty`  
`- Risk level: Medium`  
`- Fit impact: Indeterminate`

Suggested **neutral clarification** (optional for agent):

“When you say you need to think about it — is that more about timing, missing information, or internal priority?”

That’s it.

No argument. No push.

---

## **OBJECTION OUTCOMES (SYSTEM STATES)**

Each objection subflow must end in **one state**:

`{{allowed_objection_states}}:`  
`- CLARIFIED`  
`- NON-BLOCKING`  
`- BLOCKING`  
`- DISQUALIFYING`  
`- FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED`

These states feed:

* follow-up logic

* retargeting logic

* CRM pipeline movement

* AI analytics

---

## **WHY THIS IS POWERFUL**

This achieves something most sales orgs never do:

* You **separate truth from pressure**

* You **separate signal from emotion**

* You **build a dataset of real buying resistance**

* You **improve the system instead of forcing closes**

Over time:

* winning objections become patterns

* losing objections become qualification filters

* your slide deck and messaging evolve based on evidence

---

## **SYSTEM INTEGRATION POINTS**

Objection subflows connect to:

* Milestones (Layer 2\)

* Qualification engine

* Follow-up automation

* Slide effectiveness analytics

* Sales agent performance review

---

## **WHAT WE HAVE NOW**

✅ Layer 1 — Global governance  
 ✅ Layer 2 — Milestone intelligence  
 ✅ Layer 3 — Objection intelligence (without arguing)

You now have a **coherent, non-contradictory system**.

---

### **STOP POINT**

Say **“OK”** and next we will do:

➡ **Prompt Layer 4: Slide Analysis & Effectiveness Learning**  
 (this ties directly into your idea of iterating slides based on outcomes)

I will stop again after that.

Ok

Perfect.  
 Now we move to **PROMPT LAYER 4: Slide Analysis & Effectiveness Learning**.

This layer is the **core of your system advantage** — it turns every sales call into **training data** without breaking standardization.

I will deliver **Layer 4 only**, then stop.

---

# **AI PROMPT SYSTEM — LAYER 4**

## **SLIDE ANALYSIS & EFFECTIVENESS LEARNING**

---

## **FIRST: THE PRINCIPLE (LOCK THIS IN)**

**Slides are not content.**  
 **Slides are hypotheses.**

Each slide exists to:

* trigger understanding

* surface signals

* move the conversation to a *known internal state*

This layer measures whether that happened — **without changing the deck per call**.

---

## **WHAT THIS LAYER DOES (IN ONE SENTENCE)**

It evaluates **how each slide performs** across calls by correlating:

* slide exposure

* spoken content

* prospect reactions

* milestone outcomes

* downstream conversion

---

## **CRITICAL DESIGN CONSTRAINT (FROM YOU)**

✔ Slides are **NOT generated live per call**  
 ✔ Slide deck is **created once by admin**  
 ✔ Only **variables inside slides change**  
 ✔ Slide structure remains static  
 ✔ Optimization happens by **iteration over time**, not improvisation

This layer fully respects that.

---

## **CORE DATA MODEL (CONCEPTUAL)**

Each slide has a persistent identity:

`slide_id`  
`deck_id`  
`milestone_id`  
`slide_order`  
`slide_type`  
`slide_hypothesis`  
`allowed_variables`

Each **slide exposure** during a call generates:

`call_id`  
`slide_id`  
`timestamp_start`  
`timestamp_end`  
`spoken_content_reference`  
`prospect_reaction_markers`  
`agent_execution_markers`

Nothing is inferred without evidence.

---

## **SLIDE ANALYSIS PROMPT — CANONICAL TEMPLATE**

`You are analyzing a single slide interaction within a sales call.`

`Slide metadata:`  
`- Slide ID: {{slide_id}}`  
`- Milestone: {{milestone_id}}`  
`- Intended hypothesis: {{slide_hypothesis}}`  
`- Slide type: {{slide_type}}`

`Call context:`  
`- Call ID: {{call_id}}`  
`- Prospect profile snapshot: {{prospect_context}}`  
`- Qualification state at time of slide: {{qualification_state}}`

`Available evidence:`  
`- Transcript segment: {{transcript_segment}}`  
`- Timing data: {{timing_data}}`  
`- Reaction markers: {{reaction_markers}}`  
`- Agent execution notes: {{agent_notes}}`

`Your task:`  
`1. Determine whether the slide hypothesis was:`  
   `- Supported`  
   `- Neutral`  
   `- Undermined`  
`2. Identify observable signals (verbatim-based only)`  
`3. Assess agent execution quality (structure, clarity, adherence)`  
`4. Flag risks or friction introduced by the slide`  
`5. Output standardized metrics only`

`You must NOT:`  
`- Suggest copy changes`  
`- Suggest persuasive improvements`  
`- Invent intent or emotion`  
`- Override milestone outcomes`

`Output format:`  
`{{slide_analysis_schema}}`

---

## **STANDARDIZED OUTPUT METRICS (ADMIN-DEFINED)**

Example (schema controlled by admin):

`- Hypothesis outcome: Supported / Neutral / Undermined`  
`- Prospect clarity level: Low / Medium / High`  
`- Resistance signals detected: Yes / No`  
`- Objection linkage: {{objection_id or null}}`  
`- Agent adherence score: 1–5`  
`- Notes (verbatim only)`

---

## **HOW LEARNING HAPPENS (VERY IMPORTANT)**

### **❌ NOT THIS:**

* “This slide feels weak”

* “Let’s rewrite the deck”

* “Agent X closed better”

### **✅ THIS:**

* Slide X correlates with higher drop-off at Milestone 3

* Slide Y appears in 80% of closed deals

* Slide Z creates objections when shown before qualification

* Agent execution variance affects slide outcome

Only **after statistical confidence**, admin may:

* retire slide

* replace slide

* reorder slide

* split-test *at deck version level*

---

## **DECK VERSIONING MODEL**

`deck_id`  
`deck_version`  
`created_by`  
`active_status`  
`change_reason`  
`confidence_score`

Old decks remain analyzable.  
 New decks inherit structure, not assumptions.

---

## **WHY THIS IS A BIG DEAL**

You’ve essentially built:

* a **sales lab**

* a **behavioral dataset**

* a **non-opinionated optimization loop**

Most orgs optimize slides by:

“What feels right”

You optimize by:

“What repeatedly works”

---

## **SYSTEM INTEGRATIONS**

This layer feeds into:

* Sales training

* Agent performance reviews

* Slide deck evolution

* Offer refinement

* Qualification tightening

* ROI forecasting accuracy

---

## **WHAT WE HAVE NOW**

✅ Layer 1 — Governance  
 ✅ Layer 2 — Milestones  
 ✅ Layer 3 — Objection intelligence  
 ✅ Layer 4 — Slide effectiveness learning

At this point, your system:

* standardizes behavior

* learns without chaos

* improves without improvisation

* scales without losing signal

---

### **STOP POINT**

Say **“OK”** and next we will do:

➡ **Prompt Layer 5: Call-Level Synthesis & Follow-Up Automation**  
 (where recordings, summaries, emails, and CRM actions are produced)

I will stop again after that.

Ok

Perfect.  
 We now move to **PROMPT LAYER 5: Call-Level Synthesis & Follow-Up Automation**.

This layer is where **everything comes together**:

* milestones

* objections

* slides

* qualification

* recordings

* CRM

* follow-ups

I will deliver **Layer 5 only**, then stop.

---

# **AI PROMPT SYSTEM — LAYER 5**

## **CALL-LEVEL SYNTHESIS & FOLLOW-UP AUTOMATION**

---

## **CORE PRINCIPLE (LOCK THIS IN)**

**The call is not the asset.**  
 **The structured record of the call is the asset.**

Layer 5 converts:

* a complex human conversation  
   into

* a standardized, analyzable, automatable system object

---

## **WHAT LAYER 5 IS RESPONSIBLE FOR**

Layer 5 operates **after the call ends** (or is paused) and produces:

1. Call-level synthesis (neutral, factual)

2. Qualification outcome

3. Objection summary (classified)

4. Slide & milestone performance snapshot

5. CRM pipeline actions

6. Follow-up artifacts (emails, notes, tasks)

7. Continuity for follow-up calls

---

## **INPUTS (ALL VARIABLE-DRIVEN)**

`{{call_id}}`  
`{{prospect_id}}`  
`{{agent_id}}`  
`{{deck_id}}`  
`{{deck_version}}`

`{{milestone_outputs}}`  
`{{objection_outputs}}`  
`{{slide_analysis_outputs}}`

`{{call_transcript}}`  
`{{call_recording_reference}}`

`{{qualification_criteria}}`  
`{{allowed_next_actions}}`

`{{crm_mapping_rules}}`  
`{{follow_up_rules}}`

Nothing is inferred outside these inputs.

---

## **CALL SYNTHESIS PROMPT — CANONICAL TEMPLATE**

`You are synthesizing a completed sales call.`

`Context:`  
`- Call ID: {{call_id}}`  
`- Prospect ID: {{prospect_id}}`  
`- Call type: {{call_type}}`  
`- Language: {{language}}`

`Available structured inputs:`  
`- Milestone outcomes: {{milestone_outputs}}`  
`- Objection classifications: {{objection_outputs}}`  
`- Slide performance data: {{slide_analysis_outputs}}`  
`- Qualification checks: {{qualification_results}}`

`Your role:`  
`- Do NOT persuade`  
`- Do NOT sell`  
`- Do NOT optimize messaging`  
`- Do NOT reframe objections`

`Your task:`  
`1. Generate a factual call summary`  
`2. Confirm qualification status`  
`3. Identify unresolved blockers`  
`4. Determine recommended next system action`  
`5. Produce follow-up artifacts according to rules`

`All outputs must:`  
`- be neutral`  
`- reference evidence`  
`- be explicitly scoped`  
`- avoid interpretation beyond inputs`

`Output only in:`  
`{{call_summary_schema}}`

---

## **STANDARDIZED CALL SUMMARY OUTPUT**

Example schema (admin-controlled):

`CALL SUMMARY:`  
`- Prospect context (facts only)`  
`- Key stated goals`  
`- Confirmed constraints`  
`- Qualification status: Qualified / Not qualified / Conditional`  
`- Primary blockers (if any)`  
`- Objections raised (categorized)`  
`- Slides with notable impact`  
`- Agent adherence score (aggregate)`

---

## **FOLLOW-UP ARTIFACT GENERATION (CONTROLLED)**

### **Follow-up outputs may include:**

* Internal call notes

* Manager review summary

* Prospect follow-up email

* Task list for agent

* CRM pipeline updates

* Calendar follow-up creation

All governed by:

`{{follow_up_rules}}:`  
`- allowed channels`  
`- tone constraints`  
`- timing`  
`- escalation rules`

---

## **FOLLOW-UP EMAIL PROMPT (EXAMPLE TEMPLATE)**

`Generate a follow-up email based on the completed call.`

`Constraints:`  
`- Language: {{language}}`  
`- Tone: {{email_tone}}`  
`- Audience: Prospect`  
`- Purpose: {{email_purpose}}`

`Include only:`  
`- Recap of agreed facts`  
`- Confirmed next steps`  
`- No persuasion`  
`- No urgency`  
`- No new offers`

`Reference only:`  
`{{verified_call_facts}}`

`Output format:`  
`{{email_schema}}`

---

## **MULTI-CALL CONTINUITY (CRITICAL FOR YOU)**

If follow-up call is scheduled:

`FOLLOW-UP CONTEXT PACKAGE:`  
`- Previous call summary`  
`- Open milestones`  
`- Unresolved objections`  
`- Slide deck position`  
`- Qualification delta`

This ensures:

* zero restart

* no repetition

* consistent experience

* faster trust buildup

---

## **CRM / GHL INTEGRATION LOGIC**

Layer 5 triggers **system actions**, not opinions:

`If qualification = Qualified:`  
  `→ Move pipeline stage`  
  `→ Enable next call`  
  `→ Generate preparation brief`

`If qualification = Conditional:`  
  `→ Create follow-up task`  
  `→ Flag missing inputs`  
  `→ Delay automation`

`If qualification = Not Qualified:`  
  `→ Close loop`  
  `→ Tag disqualification reason`  
  `→ Suppress sales automation`

---

## **MANAGER & ADMIN VISIBILITY**

Managers can review:

* full call breakdown

* milestone pass/fail

* objection patterns

* slide effectiveness

* agent consistency

* conversion correlations

This feeds:

* training

* deck iteration

* qualification tightening

* unit economics forecasting

---

## **WHY THIS LAYER MATTERS MOST**

This is where you:

* turn conversations into data

* turn data into leverage

* turn leverage into predictable revenue

Without Layer 5, everything before it is fragile.

With Layer 5:

* nothing is lost

* nothing is anecdotal

* nothing is dependent on memory or charisma

---

## **WHAT WE HAVE NOW (COMPLETE PROMPT STACK)**

✅ Layer 1 — Global governance  
 ✅ Layer 2 — Milestones  
 ✅ Layer 3 — Objection subflows  
 ✅ Layer 4 — Slide effectiveness learning  
 ✅ Layer 5 — Call synthesis & automation

This is a **full, production-grade AI-assisted sales operating system**.

---

### **STOP POINT**

If you say **“OK”**, next we can do ONE of the following (your choice):

1️⃣ Turn this into a **full PRD**  
 2️⃣ Design the **database schema (IDs, relations)**  
 3️⃣ Define the **GHL pipeline \+ automations mapping**  
 4️⃣ Design the **agent UI / presentation UI split**  
 5️⃣ Create **manager dashboards & KPIs**

Say the number.

Yeah, let's define the database and schema for this, but also, before we do that, we need to talk about the middleware that puts all of this together. What's the logic? What are the APIs that connect all of this from the back end to the front end to the database?

Perfect — this is exactly the **right moment** to pause schema design and first lock the **middleware \+ system logic**.  
 If we don’t do this, the database will become a random storage bucket instead of a **decision engine**.

I’ll do this in **three layers**, then we’ll move to schema:

---

# **1️⃣ SYSTEM LOGIC (MENTAL MODEL)**

Think of your system as **three planes**, not a single app:

## **Plane A — Human Interaction Plane**

* Sales agent UI

* Presentation tab (client-facing)

* Notes, checklists, milestone ticks

* Zoom call, recording, reactions

➡ This plane **produces events**, not data models.

---

## **Plane B — Orchestration / Middleware Plane (THE BRAIN)**

This is the most important layer.

Its job is to:

* receive events

* validate rules

* enrich context

* trigger AI

* persist structured state

* coordinate external systems (GHL, Zoom, AI)

➡ This plane **decides what happens**, not the frontend.

---

## **Plane C — Persistence & Intelligence Plane**

* Database (truth)

* Analytics

* Learning loops

* Historical replay

* Slide effectiveness

* Agent performance

➡ This plane **remembers and learns**.

---

**Key principle**

Frontend never talks directly to AI or CRM.  
 Everything flows through middleware.

---

# **2️⃣ MIDDLEWARE RESPONSIBILITIES (VERY CLEAR)**

Your middleware is **not just an API**.  
 It is a **state machine \+ rules engine**.

### **Core responsibilities:**

### **1\. Session State Management**

Each sales call \= a **Call Session**

Middleware tracks:

* current milestone

* current slide

* objections raised

* qualification state

* agent actions

* timestamps

Frontend only *renders* state.

---

### **2\. Rule Enforcement**

Middleware enforces:

* milestone order

* required inputs

* qualification gates

* strict / non-strict mode

* hard-block toggles

AI **cannot bypass rules**.  
 Sales agents **cannot bypass rules** (unless admin allows).

---

### **3\. AI Orchestration (VERY IMPORTANT)**

AI is **stateless**.

Middleware:

* assembles context

* injects variables

* selects correct prompt layer

* validates outputs

* rejects invalid responses

AI never:

* writes directly to DB

* changes CRM

* advances milestones

---

### **4\. Event Sourcing**

Everything is an **event**, not a mutation:

Examples:

* `MILESTONE_COMPLETED`

* `SLIDE_SHOWN`

* `OBJECTION_RAISED`

* `QUALIFICATION_FAILED`

* `CALL_PAUSED`

This enables:

* replay

* audits

* analytics

* learning loops

---

### **5\. External System Coordination**

Middleware talks to:

* GoHighLevel

* Calendar

* Call recording service (Fathom-style)

* AI providers

* Slide generation service (Nano Banana Pro)

Frontend never does.

---

# **3️⃣ API ARCHITECTURE (CONCRETE)**

## **🔹 Core Internal APIs (Your App)**

### **Session API**

`POST   /sessions`  
`GET    /sessions/{id}`  
`PATCH  /sessions/{id}/state`  
`POST   /sessions/{id}/events`

Handles:

* call lifecycle

* pause / resume

* follow-up continuity

---

### **Milestone API**

`GET    /milestones`  
`POST   /sessions/{id}/milestone/advance`  
`POST   /sessions/{id}/milestone/validate`

Middleware checks:

* required fields

* objections blocking?

* qualification rules

---

### **Slide API**

`GET    /decks/{deckId}`  
`POST   /sessions/{id}/slides/{slideId}/shown`  
`POST   /sessions/{id}/slides/{slideId}/analysis`

Slide identity is **static**, data is dynamic.

---

### **Objection API**

`POST   /sessions/{id}/objections`  
`POST   /sessions/{id}/objections/{objectionId}/resolve`

“Resolve” ≠ convince  
 It means: classified & decision taken.

---

### **Qualification API**

`POST   /sessions/{id}/qualification/check`  
`GET    /qualification/rules`

Used at:

* mid-call

* pre-close

* post-call

---

## **🔹 AI Orchestration API (Internal)**

`POST /ai/milestone-analysis`  
`POST /ai/objection-classification`  
`POST /ai/slide-analysis`  
`POST /ai/call-synthesis`

Middleware:

* injects variables

* validates output schema

* stores results

---

## **🔹 External Integrations**

### **GoHighLevel**

`POST /integrations/ghl/pipeline-update`  
`POST /integrations/ghl/custom-event`  
`POST /integrations/ghl/calendar`

Used only after middleware approval.

---

### **Call Recording (Fathom-like)**

`POST /integrations/recording/start`  
`POST /integrations/recording/stop`  
`GET  /integrations/recording/{callId}`

Recording ID is linked to `call_id`.

---

### **Presentation Mode**

Frontend opens:

* `/present/{sessionId}`

Backend:

* locks agent UI

* tracks slide order

* logs timing & reactions

---

# **4️⃣ DATA FLOW (END-TO-END)**

### **Example: Slide is shown**

1. Agent clicks “Next slide”

Frontend sends event:

 `SLIDE_SHOWN`

2.   
3. Middleware:

   * validates milestone

   * timestamps event

   * stores slide exposure

4. Later:

   * transcript arrives

   * AI slide analysis triggered

5. Result stored and linked to:

   * slide\_id

   * call\_id

   * agent\_id

---

# **5️⃣ WHY THIS MATTERS**

This architecture guarantees:

✅ No AI hallucinations  
 ✅ No rogue sales behavior  
 ✅ No broken standardization  
 ✅ Perfect audit trail  
 ✅ Learnable system  
 ✅ White-label ready  
 ✅ Product-agnostic

You are not building a **sales app**.  
 You are building a **sales operating system**.
